Closed pending test case to show leak.

500. bug report number : ['382']
comment number: 2352708 
body: WX is now deprecated. Please update this thread if the problem persists in the QT build.
 

501. bug report number : ['359']
comment number: 1458560 
body: Looks fine to me when referring to X11. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System
 

comment number: 1606385 
body: this assumes specific detailed linux knowledge. 
"Start bitcoin on x window system startup" or even "Start bitcoin on/before login" would be more clear.
 

comment number: 4967171 
body: I wouldn't call this a bug, but it can be made clearer maybe. I like "Start bitcoin on login".
 

comment number: 4968992 
body: "Autostart Bitcoin after login"? On Windows it clearly happens after you typed in user and pass ^^.
 

comment number: 8763125 
body: @nilsja This is now `Start Bitcoin on system login` and IMO can be considered fixed! Just close this issue, if you agree.
 

comment number: 10473697 
body: Can be closed!
 

502. bug report number : ['358']
comment number: 1459088 
body: 1) ACK
2) ACK; I don't like using mapPubKeys as a check for whether a key is ours though (there's pwalletMain->HaveKey()), but for now it's correct.
3) ACK
4) NAK: you change the check for whether the key belongs to a certain account, but still look it up there the next line?
5) I like accessor functions for those things, but a GetDefaultAddress should return the address corresponding to vchDefaultKey, and SetDefaultAddress should update vchDefaultKey (and push to db), imho.
 

comment number: 1459684 
body: Ok i've amended the commits.

About 4), I assumed previously that mapPubKey contained a subset of mapAddressBook. Maybe it is (or will become) false, but anyway it is better to add the check.

About 5), I hope I've done the wanted changes.

About HaveKey(), there are many other occurrences of mapPubKeys that should be replaced as well.
So it's probably better to leave it unchanged until a global substitution is performed.
 

comment number: 1459726 
body: mapPubKeys is not a subset of mapAddressBook; it contains reserve keys while mapAddressBook doesn't. You can assume for now that mapPubKeys does contain all 'our' keys though, and ignore HaveKey for now.
 

comment number: 1465942 
body: Indeed. Reserve keys!
Thank you.
 

comment number: 1470739 
body: Can we get a breakdown of the original problems this addresses instead of just what was done to correct them?
 

comment number: 1475977 
body: 1) If you need a concrete appearance of the underlying problem, make some changes in your address book using the gui (current head), close the address book window, open it again. Changes are not displayed.

2) and 4) see respective links.

3) and 5) are just improvements.
 

comment number: 1479327 
body: ACK.
 

comment number: 1479997 
body: NACK - crashes when loading from empty .bitcoin - "Error to load wallet.dat"
 

comment number: 1480021 
body: Problem first showed up in 0efc5d29a2d8922b10dcd02a1f1ad7b46258edd8, Ill let you do the rest.
 

comment number: 1482389 
body: Yes a small issue with big consequences.
The address name "" was generated as the default "map"ed value, and therefore it was not written to db.

Note to myself, I should really keep away from languages that allow me to make such stupid mistakes :-)
 

comment number: 1551132 
body: Status update.

1) has been pulled.

2) and 4) are still pending fixes for outstanding bugs.
Note: expect merge conflicts with recent work by sipa.
 

comment number: 1571100 
body: If 1 has been pulled, why is its commit still listed here? Can you do a rebase, removing the already-merged parts?
 

comment number: 1571532 
body: Dunno, the first patch was kind of cherry-picked.
Here comes the clean rebase.
 

comment number: 1772568 
body: Rebased against recent changes. Removed 5) since its purpose is no so clear now.
 

comment number: 3270868

body: Hi,
See also pull #335.
 

comment number: 1442444 
body: hm right, seems that I did some duplicated effort :-)
 

comment number: 1443780 
body: Your Erase naming is more consistent with the name of other functions.
SetDefaultAddress was missing.
Also, I agree that code should be extracted from .h to .cpp files!

It's nice to see some activity, and thanks for the (indirect) feedback! :-)
 

comment number: 2299415

506. bug report number : ['344']
comment number: 1435293 
body: 23:13:51 @jine This is a patch for bitcoind from hevosenliha in #bitcoins.lc. To try to add support for keep-alive
23:13:55 @jine http://jine.be/46
23:14:18 @jine The issue with that seems to be (according to ius in #bitcoins.lc) that the connection only allows one user to connect.
23:14:31 @jine (And also, i'm having troubles with that code)
 

comment number: 1439467 
body: One thing tho, the keep-alive solution should be based upon multi-threading (as implemented before in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/214

body: Should be fixed thanks to HTTP/1.1 support
 

507. bug report number : ['330']
comment number: 4962913 
body: Keeping this open, although the immediate issue was fixed long ago it still might be nice to eventually make number parsing locale-aware.
 

comment number: 26704951 
body: I think it's time to revive this issue (or kill it forever). Do we really want number parsing and formatting in the GUI (this is oblivious to bitcoind) locale aware?
Implementation wise it's a trivial change as Qt contains everything for locale-specific number processing. 

But it may cause communication confusion between people or result in wrong amounts being sent if, for some reason, the locale is picked wrongly. This was the original reason for Satoshi to settle on one kind of number formatting. But maybe it's a misplaced concern now that we always ask for confirmation.
 

comment number: 37790802

body: In which version was this? Automatic rescanning was added in 0.3.21.
 

513. bug report number : ['307']
comment number: 1319488 
body: I don't know about bitcoin's source code, but after having a quick look inside, I believe in file rpc.c, function ListReceived(), where the is now:
    if (!AddressToHash160(strAddress, hash160))

... it should rather be:
    if (!AddressToHash160(strAddress, hash160) || !mapPubKeys.count(hash160))

And similar fix for getaddressesbyaccount.
 

comment number: 1916423 
body: I'm having the same problem.  Seems there's no way to distinguish between receiving addresses and addresses the client has sent to using the rpc.  Obviously, the client UI is doing it somehow to create the address book.

515. bug report number : ['304']
comment number: 1312572 
body: Actually, dont pull this yet, way more stuff to come.
 

comment number: 1312696 
body: Nevermind, other bug is in CryptoPP ASM when cross compiled.
 

comment number: 1319679 
body: ACK, looks good to pull to me.
 

516. bug report number : ['300']
comment number: 1306428 
body: As devrandom pointed out, tor latency could be much greater than 5s.  Maybe add if (fProxy) timeout = 20s?
 

comment number: 1308021 
body: Maybe this can be done adaptively: start with a timeout=100ms, and each time N connection attempts have failed through time-out (and not enough connections are established), double the timeout.
 

comment number: 1310748 
body: I think making it a command line override option would be a better way of handling it. In general you want to avoid connecting to other nodes where your network path is that latent. That way people who have known-latent paths can manually bump the timeout but it works as expected for most users.
 

comment number: 1311072 
body: @jrmithdobbs: good suggestion - implemented.
 

comment number: 1319859 
body: I'd prefer removing the nConnectTimeout global variable and just calling GetArg("-timeout", 5000) in ConnectSocket.
 

comment number: 1327989 
body: My name is phantomcircuit and I approve this patch.
 

comment number: 1329964 
body: @gavinandresen: I disagree - I don't like global variables, but doing parsing of command-line options all over the place is even worse.
 

comment number: 1339951 
body: bleh, this is overkill.

Use select with timeout -- as net.cpp already does -- and eliminate that polling loop.

In all of linux/osx/winsock, you issue a non-blocking connect(2), and then select(2) the socket for writing.
 

comment number: 1351925 
body: ACK final result.  Needs to be rebased though...
 

comment number: 1352596 
body: ACK -- looks OK, but I haven't had time to compile and test.
 

comment number: 1353183 
body: Now using select() instead of looping. Tested on Linux and Windows.

520. bug report number : ['258']
comment number: 1258562 
body: Overall transaction handling in db.cpp is terrible.  BDB has good transaction support, but it is only used in one or two places.
 

comment number: 1259092 
body: I looked into this a bit: I think disabling fsync for the address database is the way to go, but since we need to leave it enabled for the rest (?) of the databases, that will require creating a separate BDB [DbEnv](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17076_02/html/api_reference/CXX/envcreate.html).
 

comment number: 1386562 
body: This appears to be at least an order of magnitude worse in the OSX build than in the Linux build. Might OSX be handling the fsync'ing differently?
 

comment number: 1393242 
body: Yeah, it's absolutely abysmal on osx.
 

comment number: 1395233 
body: I didn't really notice since the macs I run it on all have SSDs. But yes, it is demonstrably worse on OS X.
 

comment number: 1433733 
body: With a high-end Mac Pro (gobs of RAM, 2 quad-core CPUs) this issue makes Bitcoin essentially unusable in conjunction with other day-to-day use of the machine.  It causes the HD to click noisily all day (with brief pauses) and degrades performance of other applications - web browsing etc.  I keep Bitcoin terminated during the day when working and just run it at night.

How large is the address DB typically and is it expected to grow with network size? (mine is ~15MB).  If it remains of that order, perhaps an option to keep it in memory would be appropriate?

I'm assuming the 'fsync' suggestion above involves modification of the code, but if there is any 'quick fix' available, that would be a useful temporary workaround for Mac users.  

Cheers (- everyones work is appreciated).
 

comment number: 1469020 
body: You might try -noflushwallet, but that probably wouldnt work and could lead to the loss of data in the wallet or the corruption of the wallet if the bitcoin client crashes while it is writing to the wallet.
 

comment number: 1526591 
body: Does every address need an fsync?  It seems that just fsyncing after key/wallet operations would be more than acceptable.  Can the address cache fsyncs be batched into blocks of 1000 or something?
 

comment number: 1714541 
body: With OS X adding addresses is _much_ slower than with Linux: it takes a very long time until it starts fetching new blocks after startup.
Note: I'm using an encrypted *.dmg for all Bitcoin data (inclusive debug.log), which could make things more worse.

Just to confirm this as a serious problem (0.3.24-beta, OS X Lion): the difference between Linux and OS X is so big (with OS X it has taken >15min until fetching first block!), that something seems to be buggy.
 

comment number: 1773052 
body: Try with some revision that is more recent than 24271c542b9a0d6016badf5438fb7e5ff7961ace.
This patch reduces db commits when addresses are added.

comment number: 1593259 
body: Aww. The removal of this would mean we can't run a lottery for nodes running the most recent version of bitcoin as an incentive to make people upgrade. :)
 

comment number: 1593434 
body: Wow, you probably hit upon the first actual useful application for send to
IP transactions. But watch out for people MITMing you to steal the
incentives :)
 

comment number: 1593448 
body: Well, if they are going to go through the trouble of setting up something that _pretends_ to be a current node it would be easier to actually RUN a current node.  The lottery could do some reasonable health checks too. :)  Like make sure the winner can feed the block chain and forward a transaction.

529. bug report number : ['236']
comment number: 1198435 
body: Seems like a nice, well-defined problem for somebody new to tackle.  Conversion of difficulty to floating point isn't a critical function (internally it is all uint256's), and we're not going to get to 2 billion difficulty soon, so not high priority.
 

530. bug report number : ['231']
comment number: 1194051 
body: This is a manifestation of the error fixed in 2f62b1299f1d2d8e56ff9096017b1f3835b41642.  That said, it is still an indication of a more underlying error which should be investigated.  Probably an issue in SendMoney.
 

comment number: 1195621 
body: As an addendum to this issue, the client first displayed a message box telling me about a transaction fee (0.01) for which I pressed the 'Ok' button...it is at that point it displayed the error message above...
 

comment number: 3019190 
body: This bug is related to wxGTK which was removed in 0.5.0.
 

531. bug report number : ['216']
comment number: 1129850 
body: This is a feature to prevent the remaining 0.00XXXX from being lost as you can't send that without a 0.01 fee which you can't have if your balance is <0.01
 

comment number: 1130107 
body: Yes, but if I have 10.01999999 bitcoins, and am in a pool, I could safely assume that I would be able to make 0.00000001 bitcoins to then have whole cent within a reasonable amount of time. The feature should be to simply not allow you to send a transaction if you have less than 0.01 rather than sending it along with the whole cent. Otherwise, it's theft of coin (negligible or not) by the network.
 

comment number: 1130591 
body: You cannot send a coin smaller than 0.01 without paying a transaction fee.  So if you had a 10.019, and you got a 0.001 payment (whoever sent that would have had to pay a fee), you cannot resend that 0.001 payment without paying a 0.01 bitcoin fee.  I know it looks like you have exactly 10.02 BTC in that case, but to bitcoin you have a 10.019BTC "coin" and a 0.001 BTC "coin".
 

comment number: 1134090 
body: In that case, it should notify users that, if they have a balance of 1.01999999 and they send someone 1 BTC with a 0.01 TxFee, they are sending them their subcent balance with it.
 

comment number: 1134810 
body: Yep, the GUI should definitely notify the user, so lets keep this issue open until that is fixed.
 

comment number: 4044411 
body: I believe the current Qt GUI behaves correctly now.
 

comment number: 4091361 
body: @laanwj Does this problem still exist?

You shouldnt be trying the 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine.  And you didn't answer my question, do you see these errors on the 64-bit version as well, or only when you are running the wrong binary?
 

comment number: 1304750 
body: OK.  When I run the 32 bit it core dumps (can I say that any other
way?).  There you go.

comment number: 1305036 
body: According to your first comment, you are on a 64-bit machine, correct?
When you run the 32-bit binary, it is expected that it will not work.  Thus what you are saying is not a bug.
My question is...when you run the proper (ie 64-bit) binary, does the same problem present itself?
 

comment number: 1305083 
body: I understand that running 32 bit on 64 is not a bug.  The messages
appear when running the 64 bit since I am only 64 bit.  The messages
can be suppressed by unchecking a box on the error message dialog and
then hitting the continue button.  The client then runs without a
problem.  I did install the wxwidgets from their site, but it didn't
seem to include any extra fonts.  I gave up on the problem since the
client works fine and I can see all the text with no issues.  I would
classify it as a bug, but not a show stopper.  Will you enter it into
the bug tracking system?  Or is there such a system?

comment number: 1305252 
body: You are on the bug-tracking system.  Anyway, sorry for the confusion, just wanted to make sure as it was not clear from the first couple of posts.  Can you give any more info on your system, as I dont see this error on a clean Ubuntu LiveCD.  Are you running Kubuntu or some other flavor, what packages might you have removed that were in the default install?

body: I am running Lucid, but have not really removed a lot of packages.
Maybe the fonts will be available in Maverick or Natty.

comment number: 5763861 
body: Do you know if there is any applicable workaround ?

I have a case where I imported a lot of private keys into a wallet, and there's starting to be a very significant discrepancy between what `getbalance` and what `getbalance '*'` report, I suspect that this issue might be somehow related as the difference increases with time and with transactions that are being sent...

Any help whatever small would be immensely appreciated !

comment number: 1201797

539. bug report number : ['94']
comment number: 831764 
body: Since that commit stripped out the inclusion of WXINCLUDEPATHS in the defs and moved it to the obj/%.o location instead. This means the nogui option compilation doesn't receive the **WXGTK** define, which is #ifdef'ing out the daemonizing fork() call. (Which itself is probably the genesis of this bug.)

542. bug report number : ['86']
comment number: 820868 
body: Is there another potential issue here?  For transactions that, for one reason or another, don't get into a block in a reasonable amount of time, is there some criteria for which the network will drop (and thereby cancel) such transactions?  (like a certain amount of time passing without being included in a block)
 

comment number: 822157 
body: afaik, there is currently no mechanism that would drop transactions from local cache. They just stay there until found in a block.

It's been suggested to do that, though (like limit local cache to 5MB), in order to avoid DoS attack. It's probably not that simple, though.

Don't know if there's a github issue for this, if not, it certainly deserves one.

comment number: 1532209 
body: init.cpp:308 
`#if defined(__WXMSW__) && defined(GUI)
// wxSingleInstanceChecker doesn't work on Linux
...
#endif`

Probably the whole block should be removed so long as lock file works right on windows.
 

comment number: 1533126 
body: Seems that single instance check is older than the lock file code. The whole block is obsolete.
Just tried it, locking works fine without that checking.

body: RE: add address:  Adding a sending address to your address book you have to paste the address that you're sending to.

If you click on the Receiving address tab you don't specify the new address, bitcoin generates it for you.

Organizing would be a new feature.
 

comment number: 799178 
body: Rendering issues were resolved by building with the mingw toolchain.
 

547. bug report number : ['69']
comment number: 774815 
body: I'm seeing something that's probably related. When Bitcoin is underneath a window, and then brought to the top, the background of the tool strip appears to not get repainted. See this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/uSkud.png
 

comment number: 788315 
body: Please try 0.3.20.01 (binaries at SourceForge, replaces the first candidate 0.3.20 release).  It is built with the mingw toolchain, we I hope fixes these issues.
Let us know if it works for you.
 

comment number: 799174 
body: Rendering issues went away compiling with the mingw toolchain.

Go figure.

comment number: 772743 
body: What version of bitcoin ?   I compiled the windows 0.3.20 bitcoin with boost 1.45.0...
 

comment number: 788326 
body: More info:  m0mchil couldn't compile boost 1.45 with mingw, he downgraded to 1.43 for the windows bitcoin 0.3.20.01 release.
 

comment number: 816760 
body: I successfully compiled with boost_1_46_0 on my Mac (OSX 10.6.6).  I suggest trying with that and if it works for you, maybe it could be added to the Mac build instructions that version 1_45_0 may not work.

comment number: 4091463 
body: @laanwj I read compatibility with NVDA was recently added?
 

comment number: 4098806 
body: Yes; Qt has native support for NVDA, but in windows (with static linking) it was not yet enabled.

I don't know how usable it currently is with screen reader, though. It might be that some hints etc still need to be added.
 

comment number: 4960944 
body: I'm going to close this, because accessibility support was turned on.  If there are still specific issues new issues should be opened.
 

550. bug report number : ['49']
comment number: 723996 
body: I'm not able to reproduce this in ubuntu 11.04's development version, but I'm using an English locale.

Could you show me the output of running this in a terminal please, so I can better reproduce your environment?

env | grep -i -e 'c[sz]' -e lc

remove anything private from the output, should there be something you don't want to post.

Thanks.

Chris.

comment number: 724337 
body: I still can't reproduce it, even with those settings.

Are you using the official build?  32 or 64 bit?  When does it crash; before or after the GUI appears?  What's the last few lines in ~/.bitcoin/debug.log when it crashes?  Can you get a gdb backtrace?
 

comment number: 822083 
body: I have confirmed the bug on Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS.  It's triggered when /proc/self/exe links to a UTF-8 path.  Behavior differs depending on LANG setting.
- LANG=C: bitcoin runs just fine
- LANG=DE: assertion fails../src/common/intl.cpp(2554): assert "!m_strShort.empty()" failed in AddCatalog(): must initialize catalog first
- LANG=cs_CZ.utf8: bitcoin silently segfaults, gdb shows corrupted stack trace.  

strace suggests it happens during or right after this line, I think it's a wxLocale bug.

src/ui.cpp:    g_locale.AddCatalog("wxstd"); // wxWidgets standard translations, if any
 

comment number: 3956709 
body: Was this a wx issue? Can anyone please re-test this with 0.5.0+?
