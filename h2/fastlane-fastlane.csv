174,15-04-03,Issue 174 : saves .png images from ITC as .jpg ， Issue #174 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub When i am trying to use fastlane deploy  i get the following error for all images  that where previously downloaded automatically from ITC: ERROR ITMS-9001: "/2fe65325869b498dd8d6975b571f9e42.jpg does not match type JPEG Image because of these validation issues: ; Error=com.apple.jingle.leghorn.fileformat.ValidationError@4f521bee[userString=This file does not start with a start of image marker.]" at Software/SoftwareMetadata/SoftwareVersion/SoftwareVersionLanguageDetail ... Transporter transfer failed. After taking a closer look at the mentioned files  i saw that the .jpg files are PNG files. So why are they stored with the wrong extension in the fastlane/[AppleID].itmsp?,0

519,15-08-20,Issue 519 : Generated .ipa size too big ， Issue #519 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Using Xcode 7 Beta 5  Swift 2.0 and fastlane 1.19.0 our generated .ipa file size has increased from 9.8 MB to 60 MB. Picking the archive produced by fastlane in Xcode Organizer and exporting for enterprise deployment the target .ipa file has the expected size of 9.8 MB.

1039,15-12-29,Issue 1039 : Git Last Tag on a shallow clone ， Issue #1039 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I have a question about working with the git_last_tag command on a shallow clone. I'm using bamboo as my CI server and fastlane. Bamboo (by default) does a shallow clone which doesn't seem to be pulling tags correctly. I follow that up with a git fetch --tags which then pulls in the tags. I've noticed in git_helper.rb it looks like the last_tag command is doing git describe --tags --abbrev=0 def self.last_git_tag_name(match_lightweight = true)   command = ['git describe']   command << '--tags' if match_lightweight   command << '--abbrev=0'   Actions.sh(command.join(' ')  log: false).chomp  rescue   nil  end  This doesn't seem to be working correctly whereas the command: git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`  does pull the last tag correctly. Should the code be updated to mirror this behavior? I guess i'm a little clear what "last_tag" means.,0
1065,16-01-07,Issue 1065 : get_build_number from project fails if not only digits ， Issue #1065 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I tried to use get_build_number(xcodeproj: "test.xcodeproj") where the build number contains also letter e.g TE102.

1164,16-01-21,Issue 1164 : Upload to crashlytics is not stable ， Issue #1164 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I'm using fastlane for nightly buids and keep them in the crashlytics.

1422,16-02-26,Issue 1422 : set_info_plist_value changes Info.plist XML header to "... Apple Computer"; PlistBuddy changes it to "Apple" = diff annoyance ， Issue #1422 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I use the GIT_COMMIT_COUNT trick for build numbers powered by PlistBuddy in the Xcode build phases normally. But I found the version doesn't stick around if I run gym. So I resort to wrapping another pair of set_info_plist_value steps around gym in my Fastfile like so:   # Set build version  (A)   build_number = number_of_commits   set_info_plist_value(path: 'MakeEatSeeApp/Info.plist'  key: 'CFBundleVersion'  value: build_number.to_s)    gym(     workspace: workspace      scheme: scheme      configuration: configuration      output_directory: '/tmp'      output_name: output_name   )    # Reset the build version  (B)   set_info_plist_value(path: 'MakeEatSeeApp/Info.plist'  key: 'CFBundleVersion'  value: "GIT_COMMIT_COUNT") When I run this  the value of CFBundleVersion sure enough gets updated as I desired: GIT_COMMIT_COUNT    # this value is checked into Git 12345                               # Xcode Build Phase replaces GIT_COMMIT_COUNT with `git rev-list --count HEAD` GIT_COMMIT_COUNT    # end of Xcode Build Phases  sets the value back 12345                               # Fastlane's set_info_plist_value doing its magic (A) above GIT_COMMIT_COUNT   ?# end of lane: set_info_plist_value sets it back again.  So all is well  except I get this undesired diff as a side-effect: -<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> +<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> What can I do here? :(,0
1424,16-02-26,Issue 1424 : Fastlane action verify_build making invalid assertion ， Issue #1424 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Hey All  I've been playing with the new verify_build action (we were very excited to see it as we have our own custom scripts that do something similar). I don't believe the following exception is valid: raise "Inconsistent identifier found" unless plist['Entitlements']['application-identifier'] == "#{values['team_identifier']}.#{values['bundle_identifier']}"  Our app's bundle identifier is not prefixed by our team identifier but is prefixed with another value. This makes the entire action unusable since the exception is raised regardless of whether or not you passed in 'bundle_identifier' to be verified.,0

Exit status: 65 ， Issue #1679 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @buscarini - Imported from fastlane/snapshot#330 I upgraded a project from the old UIAutomation method to the new snapshot  and it's not working for me. I get an exit status 65  but there's no visible error above. I am getting a lot of warnings like this: Could not resolve external type c:objc(cs)NSString Which seems to be because of the latest Xcode  and the fact that I have some libraries with precompiled headers  module enabled and such things. If I run the tests in Xcode everything runs fine despite all these warnings. Any idea how to debug this?,0

1873,16-03-01,Issue 1873 : Pilot fails even though it finishes uploading the Build ， Issue #1873 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @Ybrin - Imported from fastlane/pilot#157 I am currently using pilot together with fastlane in travis-ci and everything works fine  my builds are being uploaded to TestFlight and published to the internal Testers as it should.

1875,16-02-24,Issue 1875 : Pilot bails out when it takes some time for an uploaded build to appear in iTunes Connect ， Issue #1875 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @petterikamppuririchie - Imported from fastlane/pilot#151 It seems that it takes some time for iTunes Connect to start showing an uploaded build. Pilot doesn't seem to like it  and it crashes here: /var/lib/gems/2.0.0/gems/pilot-1.4.1/lib/pilot/build_manager.rb:88:in `wait_for_processing_build': [!] undefined method `train_version' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)     from /var/lib/gems/2.0.0/gems/pilot-1.4.1/lib/pilot/build_manager.rb:25:in `upload'     from /var/lib/gems/2.0.0/gems/pilot-1.4.1/lib/pilot/commands_generator.rb:59:in `block (2 levels) in run'  I think this happens because there are no builds processing at pilot/_buildmanager.rb line 78 break if builds.count == 0. This breaks the submission part of Pilot. Has anyone else seen this? P.S. I'm trying to setup a Linux server to do the uploads (I cannot wait for processing to finish on an expensive Mac machine we have in the cloud). Not very easy :) Really waiting for fastlane/fastlane_core#73 to be finished  and even after that I'd need a way to customize iTMSTransporter path.,0

1979,16-03-03,Issue 1979 : No matching provisioning profiles found in `readonly` mode ， Issue #1979 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @mr-casual - Imported from fastlane/match#148 Finally I found a solution to use match to generate a certificate and provisioning profile for enterprise distribution. I just use the type "appstore"  because with "adhoc" it wasn't working. But on our Jenkins I want to run match in readonly mode. The problem is  I get this error message  when I run it in readonly mode (The same on my local machine): No matching provisioning profiles found and can not create a new one because you enabledreadonly`` The lane looks like this: lane :match_enterprise do |options|           match(               git_url: "*******"                type: "appstore"                app_identifier: "com.MyApp.*"                username: "*******"                team_id: "*******"                readonly: options[:readonly]                force: options[:force]               )     end  The log on my local machine: INFO [2016-03-02 18:58:13.52]: ------------------------------------------------- INFO [2016-03-02 18:58:13.52]: --- Step: Switch to ios match_enterprise lane --- INFO [2016-03-02 18:58:13.52]: ------------------------------------------------- INFO [2016-03-02 18:58:13.52]: Cruising over to lane 'ios match_enterprise' ?

2328,15-04-30,Issue 2328 : Binary uploaded  but not changed for previously created version on iTC ， Issue #2328 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @douglaslondrina - Imported from fastlane/deliver#191 In a situation where a version is already created on iTunes Connect and is waiting for the user to "Submit for Review" and a build is already in place  if a new build is created and sent  all information is updated but the binary  leading to incorrect app being submitted. The new binary is actually there  it's just not selected. In my opinion the correct behaviour should select the newer binary or even delete the previous submitted. Just to illustrate  this was a new version created and submitted: But the build used was a old one: Running deliver 0.9.1  will update now and try again.,0

2670,16-03-08,Issue 2670 : Update Product Bundle Identifier When Using update_info_plist ， Issue #2670 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Updating the Bundle Identifier via the update_info_plist action will result in an error when uploading an app with a Distribution provisioning profile because the identifier will not match the Product Bundle Identifier value in Build Settings -> Packaging -> Product Bundle Identifier. The error will occur when uploading via Pilot or Deliver. From the Xcode 7.0 release notes: The new build setting Product Bundle Identifier (PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER) is the recommended place to set the Bundle Identifier for a target. The target¨s Info.plist should be configured to use this build setting by referencing it as $(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER) in the value for the CFBundleIdentifier key. Xcode offers to configure this for you when you accept the ＾Upgrade to recommended settings￣ project modernization in the issue navigator  unless your target preprocesses its Info.plist file. In that case you will need to configure this setting manually. This change is backwards-compatible to older versions of Xcode. This change is required to make certain features work  such as On Demand Resources  if your target preprocesses its Info.plist file. (20887827) Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used First running this command via a lane in my Fastfile. The app_identifier prior to running this is com.foreup.6279     update_info_plist(       plist_path: "./ForeUpCore/Info.plist"        display_name: "Dotha"        app_identifier: com.foreup.558     )  The Info.plist is updated  but the value in Build Settings -> Packaging -> Product Bundle Identifier remains the old value. Then running pilot will result in the error: [16:39:14]: ------------------- [16:39:14]: --- Step: pilot --- [16:39:14]: ------------------- [16:39:14]: Login to iTunes Connect (mobile@foreup.com) [16:39:17]: Login successful [16:39:18]: Ready to upload new build to TestFlight (App: 1089387521)...

If I delete the app in the simulator its correctly installed  but if I just run snapshot it doesn't seem to push the new app. Have you seen anything like this? Any suggestion? Logging? Murray,0
2746,14-11-15,Issue 2746 : pass also regional settings at building ， Issue #2746 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @MichaelRohs - Imported from fastlane/snapshot#4 Currently snapshot passes the language at building. This provides screenshots in different languages  which is one of the top benefits of snapshot. When the app displays fields like date  time and amount  it would be appropriate to set also the corresponding region. Otherwise you will receive screenshots with german texts and dates in US date format or vice versa  for example. Thanks.,0

3036,15-12-17,Issue 3036 : iTunes Connect app produce crash ， Issue #3036 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @gfreh - Imported from fastlane/produce#105 Hi  guys. I'm not really sure it's a bug... but let's see: I've written a script that calls produce passing all necessary parameters. Everything was working fine  but  as we have to developer teams  it was always asking me what team I'd like to use. Taking a look into the global options list  I've found this two: -k  --itc_team_id    The ID of your iTunes Connect team if you're in multiple teams (PRODUCE_ITC_TEAM_ID) -p  --itc_team_name STRING The name of your iTunes Connect team if you're in multiple teams (PRODUCE_ITC_TEAM_NAME)  Then I tried to use them... --itc_team_name seems to work fine  but --itc_team_id doesn't. When I provide only the --itc_team_id  the summary for produce tells me --itc_team_id is true. On the other hand  when I provide --itc_team_name  summary shows me the value I provided. Also  when provided  --itc_team_id causes produce to crash with the following stack trace: /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/spaceship-0.15.2/lib/spaceship/tunes/tunes_client.rb:207:in `handle_itc_response': invalid request body (Spaceship::TunesClient::ITunesConnectError)     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/spaceship-0.15.2/lib/spaceship/tunes/tunes_client.rb:66:in `team_id='     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/spaceship-0.15.2/lib/spaceship/tunes/tunes_client.rb:87:in `select_team'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/produce-1.1.0/lib/produce/itunes_connect.rb:10:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/produce-1.1.0/lib/produce/manager.rb:8:in `start_producing'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/produce-1.1.0/bin/produce:33:in `block (2 levels) in run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:153:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/runner.rb:428:in `run_active_command'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/runner.rb:68:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/delegates.rb:15:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/produce-1.1.0/bin/produce:123:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/produce-1.1.0/bin/produce:129:in `<top (required)>'     from /usr/local/bin/produce:23:in `load'     from /usr/local/bin/produce:23:in `<main>'  Is it really a bug?

3361,15-10-27,Issue 3361 : Specified destination not in list of valid destinations ， Issue #3361 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Original issue by @nmccann - Imported from fastlane/scan#17 Hi  I recently attempted to migrate my Fastfile from using Xcodebuild to using Scan  but encountered the following error on our CI server: Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier. Our server has a large number of devices  and I was able to find that the ID Scan was looking for belonged to a device with an older version of iOS - one that wasn't supported by my app. This appears to be caused by only filtering based on the device's name (as seen on this line)  rather than a combination of it's name and desired version. Ideally this the desired version could be determined automatically  perhaps based on the deployment target. As a simpler alternative it could be passed as a parameter. Thank you for your time and the excellent suite of tools! Noah,0

3639,16-03-10,Issue 3639 : Screenshots correctly pulled from device but it says "No screenshots were detected" ， Issue #3639 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description When I run screengrab  my tests are executed successfully and the screenshots are moved to the correct output path  but then it fails saying "No screenshots were detected" (which is not true). I did a little digging and it seems  that the issue is the absolute path which I entered in the Screengrabfile  because in the runner.rb the output path gets concatenated to ./  which results in ./Users/demouser/demoapp/screenshot_path/**/device_type_dir_name/*.png Can this be fixed somehow? I need the absolute path to store the screenshots there...

3664,16-03-10,Issue 3664 : Potential Issue with update_info_plist ， Issue #3664 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I'm pretty sure there is an issue with update_info_plist action. I keep coming getting these git-diff "thingys" all the time: -<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> +<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">  It looks like its stripping Computer out of the plist. - I'm not 100% sure this is the culprit but I am running that function (a lot) and I think besides xcode its the only thing touching the plist file. I'll try to look in more detail tomorrow.,0

3906,16-03-23,Issue 3906 : Fastlane gym should force signing with profile from sigh ， Issue #3906 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description This is a follow-up to #1393. For my use case  manually setting the provisioning profile in the code signing section to an env variable including the app_identifier won't work because I'm working on a white-label app where the app_identifier is selected at build time from hundreds of potential app_identifiers. I don't see any reason why fastlane couldn't update the pbxproj settings directly as update_app_identifier does. This is what fastlane's all about  using the suite of tools and having it "just work". So if sigh generates a provisioning profile  gym should automatically use it and currently that's not the case even though it finds lane_context[Actions::SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH] it's not actually used if the corresponding UDIDs aren't updated in the xcodeproj's pbxproj. I'm currently using this custom action to definitively set the provisioning profile. def set_provisioning_profile(params)   info_plist_key = 'INFOPLIST_FILE'   identifier_key = 'PROVISIONING_PROFILE'    path = File.expand_path(File.join(ENV['PWD']  params[:xcodeproj]))   project = Xcodeproj::Project.open(path)    # Fetch the build configuration objects   configs = project.objects.select { |obj| obj.isa == 'XCBuildConfiguration' && !obj.build_settings[identifier_key].nil? }   raise "Info plist uses $(#{identifier_key})  but xcodeproj does not".red unless configs.count > 0    configs = configs.select { |obj| obj.build_settings[info_plist_key] == params[:plist_path] }   raise "Xcodeproj doesn't have configuration with info plist #{params[:plist_path]}.".red unless configs.count > 0    # For each of the build configurations  set app identifier   configs.each do |c|     puts c.build_settings[identifier_key].blue     c.build_settings[identifier_key] = params[:udid]   end    # Write changes to the file   project.save    UI.success("Updated #{params[:xcodeproj]} ?.") end @KrauseFx perhaps this could be added as another action or integrated more tightly into sigh / gym?

4049,16-04-05,Issue 4049 : spaceship on master: sigh doesn't work without iTunes Connect account ， Issue #4049 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Hi  Shortly: Sine sigh 1.6.x it is not possible to download provisioning profile using Apple ID which doesn't have access to iTines Connect. If the Apple ID has access to the iTunes Connect it is possible to download or create provisioning profile using sigh  this is normal behaviour. But in my case  I've special user (Apple ID) which has only access to Member Center / Developer Program which is used to download provisioning profiles and use them in the Jenkins node. With this account I'm not able to download any provisioning profile. This issue doesn't occur on the sigh 1.5.x and it is probably related to the new spaceship which can handle "two factor authentication". As I saw in the code  spaceship/sigh tries to login to the iTunes Connect which in my case always fails.

4059,16-04-05,Issue 4059 : Scan hangs when getting build settings ， Issue #4059 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Scan hangs when getting the build settings: xcrun xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -workspace './App.xcworkspace' -scheme 'AppTests'  A couple things to note: I thought that it was related to #1844 since it was the last command showing up in the logs  but after looking at the stacktrace when I force quite fastlane  it seems that it's actually hanging on showBuildSettings. I can reproduce the freeze by running the -showBuildSettings command manually  though it only happens one time out of five  something like that. It happens consistently when running in a CI environment (circleci 7.3) It started happening after I removed all files in the App target from the AppTests target. Instead  I now have @testable import App everywhere. This change required to modify my Podfile to have different pods for the AppTests target (see below) DerivedData is relative to my project directory. Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used Please note that I modified fastlane_core's sources to show the build settings command  which is why it shows up in the logs. If I hadn't  only the -list command would appear. ldiqual@ldiqual-mbp ~/S/App-ios-test1> bundle exec fastlane test --verbose /Users/ldiqual/.rbenv/versions/2.3.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/user_interaction.rb:334: warning: constant ::TimeoutError is deprecated INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: --------------------------- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: --- Step: opt_out_usage --- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: --------------------------- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: Disabled upload of used actions INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: ------------------------------------------------- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: --- Step: Verifying required fastlane version --- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: ------------------------------------------------- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: fastlane version valid INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: ------------------------------ INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: --- Step: default_platform --- INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.74]: ------------------------------ INFO [2016-04-04 15:18:48.91]: Driving the lane 'ios test' ?

4064,16-04-05,Issue 4064 : [Fastlane] Cocoapods Repo Update ， Issue #4064 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description It looks like cocoapods has changed the default behavior of the install commands in the latest betas due to the Github Meta Issue. The repo-update parameter must now be included if you want to update the specs repo: From Cocoapods Changelog Running pod install doesn't imply an automatic spec repo update. The old behavior can be achieved by passing in the option --repo-update or running pod repo update. Marius Rackwitz #5004  Remove the configuration variable skip_repo_update as the default behavior varies now between pod install and pod (update|outdated). Marius Rackwitz #5017,0

You can find it in the Xcode Organizer. However the archive is actually not stored in the Xcode Organizer because I specified an archive path parameter. The solution would be to either: Also store the archive in the Organizer Add a flag that allows the user to set to also store the archive in the organizer Remove the message when the archive path is specified.

4088,16-04-07,Issue 4088 : update_app_identifier is saving the Project.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj in XML format ， Issue #4088 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description After upgrading to Xcode 7.3  when running fastlane and trying to get the new build number by executing increment_build_number action we started getting the error below. After some research we've found that after running update_app_identifier action the format of the project.pbxproj changed to XML while the one supported by agvtool it seems to be some sort for Json format now  so running increment_build_number or get_version_number won't no longer work as they are wrappers of agvtool. This issue has appeared after migrating to Xcode 7.3  it seems before that was not an issue for agvtool or something. So even if you try to run agvtool next-version -allor even agvtool what-version -terse manually  after a update_app_identifier action  they won't work as it's changing the format of the project.pbxproj file and avgtoolis not able to read it and returns 6. After further look at update_app_identifier.rb it seems that it's parsing the project.pbxproj as XML  therefore when it saves it back it's saving it as XML (not 100% sure here).

4114,16-04-08,Issue 4114 : Different position of padded frame due to title's character height ， Issue #4114 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Example Situation Having two titles for two screenshots (same device  same resolution). One title contains characters with descenders extending the baseline (g  p  j  q  y). The other title does not. Example titles to reproduce the issue: "Product" <- no descenders below baseline at all "Catalog" <- descender to the baseline due to "g" See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height for details about that part of typography. Used Font is: Open Sans Expected Use the padding as "offset" and always start at the same position to create a homogeneous layout ready for the Apple App Store ;) Actual The position is shifted. Seeing the screenshots in the store would be unbalanced  as they are presented in a scrollview side-by-side. framefile.json {     "default": {         "keyword": {             "font": "./fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf"              "color": "#df0a25"         }          "title": {             "font": "./fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Light.ttf"              "color": "#515151"         }          "background": "./background.jpg"          "padding": 70     }       "data": [] }  title.strings "Products" = "Product catalog"; "Selector" = "Product selector";   Environment frameit 2.5.1 Screenshots Source of the Problem In editor.rb line 246 ImageMagick's (better MiniMagick's) .gravity property is used to position the text. From: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/annotating/#gravity_text There is one very important difference between positioning images and text. If you draw a text string  without defining any form of "-gravity"  the string will be drawn relative to the 'baseline' of the font. In turn  using gravity will fight with the baseline as seen in the screenshots and leading to unbalanced text heights returned. The logic of trimming of the title in editor.rb line 251 is the source of the problem. Probably take the notes regarding .gravity from above into account. Looking forward to discuss this.,0
4134,16-04-09,Issue 4134 : Typo in Provisioning Profile UUID keys (from sigh) ， Issue #4134 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description fastlane contains a typo for environment variables and references to provisioning profile UUIDs. Several places in the docs  this appears (for example  in the old codesigning guide): To fill the profile in using environment variables use PROVISIONING_PROFILE = "$(PROFILE_UUID)";  This allows the Xcode project to use Automatic provisioning profiles and enables fastlane to set a custom profile. In your Fastfile  add the following between your sigh and gym call: sigh  # use the UDID of the newly created provisioning profile ENV["PROFILE_UUID"] = lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]  gym(scheme: "Release")  My fastfile  as seen below  instead references: ENV["PROFILE_UDID"] = lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]  A quick search of the fastlane repo still turns up several instances of "UDID": fastlane/docs/Advanced.md 177:lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                 # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile  fastlane/docs/CodeSigning.md 43:ENV["PROFILE_UUID"] = lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]  fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/sigh.rb 6:      SIGH_UDID = :SIGH_UDID 25:          Actions.lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID] = ENV["SIGH_UDID"] if ENV["SIGH_UDID"] # The UDID of the new profile 29:          return ENV["SIGH_UDID"] # return the UDID of the new profile  fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/update_project_code_signing.rb 43:                                       default_value: ENV["SIGH_UDID"])  fastlane/spec/actions_specs/sigh_spec.rb 12:        ENV["SIGH_UDID"] = "udid"  sigh/lib/sigh/local_manage.rb 18:      profile_filename = ENV["SIGH_UDID"] + ".mobileprovision"  sigh/lib/sigh/manager.rb 39:      ENV["SIGH_UDID"] = udid if udid  Should this be UUID?

4287,16-04-21,Issue 4287 : [sigh] AppIdentifierPrefix entry not updated by resign command ， Issue #4287 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description While resigning .ipa file with resign command and underlying resign.sh bash script  the AppIdnetifierPrefix entry in the resigned app's Info.plist is not updated. As a result  after resigning Enterprise build for App Store distribution  the AppIdentifierPrefix is not updated and App Store build contains Enterprise app ID prefix. Reproduction Steps Use Enterprise distribution credentials to build .ipa file Enterprise app identifier prefix: 12345678 Enterprise team ID: 12345678 The Info.plist of built .ipa has ApplicationIdentifierPrefix entry set to 12345678 Resign enterprise .ipa using sigh for App Store distribution using new provisioning profile App Store app identifier prefix in new profile: ABCDEFGH App Store team ID in new profile: ABCDEFGH Check Info.plist of resigned .ipa Expected ApplicationIdentifierPrefix value: ABCDEFGH Actual ApplicationIdentifierPrefix value: 12345678 resign.sh did not update ApplicationIdentifierPrefix entry. The script reads new ApplicationIdentifierPrefix from provisioning profile on line 363  but never writes it back to the app Info.plist. Just like CFBundleIdentifier and other keys  the ApplicationIdentifierPrefix has to be updated to new value. Environment sigh version: 1.6.1 Do you use bundler to execute sigh: yes Do you use a Ruby environment manager: rvm,0

4336,16-04-24,Issue 4336 : Integer ConfigItems always default to zero ， Issue #4336 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines ? Issue Description ConfigItem incorrectly causes all instances with data_type Integer to default to 0. The issue is the auto_convert_value method on ConfigItem. If the data_type is Integer  that method unconditionally casts value to Integer. Casting nil to Integer results in 0  not nil. That means that by the time that control reaches here  value is not nil  so the default value is not properly substituted. A specific example of the bug is in pilot's wait_processing_interval parameter. It should default to 30  but instead it is read as 0 here  in the BuildManager. As a result  the sleep has no effect  and instead just loops as fast as possible  constrained only by the response time of iTunes Connect  which is about a second in my tests. You can see the evidence of this issue in my log output  below: [12:05:25]: Waiting for iTunes Connect to process the new build [12:05:27]: Waiting for iTunes Connect to process the new build [12:05:28]: Waiting for iTunes Connect to process the new build [12:05:29]: Waiting for iTunes Connect to process the new build [12:05:30]: Waiting for iTunes Connect to process the new build  showing that we're hitting iTunes Connect about once per second  instead of the intended default once per thirty seconds. The fix should be pretty straightforward  and I may even take a swing at it after #3888. We'll want to check all ConfigItems that use the type Integer  though  to make sure we're not introducing any regressions.

4397,16-04-28,Issue 4397 : [sigh] Resigning without explicit entitlements looses keychain access group information ， Issue #4397 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated sigh to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Scenario 1: Resigning Expired Enterprise IPA Input: Expired IPA built for Enterprise distribution (provisioning profile has expired) IPA was codesigned with entitlements that included keychain-access-group value like this: New provisioning profile New provisioning profile has keychain-access-group value as follows: This is standard for provisioning profiles to look like this No original entitlements file Why this is the case is another question  let's assume this is the situation we have to deal with. When resigning with sigh resign  the resign.sh script doesn't find entitlements and extracts them from provided provisioning profile. The resigned IPA then contains keychain access group value different from the original IPA. As a result  new IPA will not be able to access shared keychain values created by previous IPA. This is serious issue and will show up while testing upgrade scenario. Detailed picture: Scenario 2: Resigning Enterprise IPA for App Store distribution This scenario is similar to Scenario 1. The only difference is that IPA is now resigned for App Store distribution  changing bundle identifier  app prefix  team ID and other values in the process. Here again  the new IPA will have keychain access group like APPSTORETEAMID.* and will be incompatible with previous App Store version  which was resigned by another script  not sigh. Proposed Fix The proposed fix is to extract entitlements both from new provisioning profile and from current app. Extracting entitlements form the app is possible with command like this: /usr/bin/codesign -d --entitlements entitlements.plist Payload/MyApp.app. The provisioning profile entitlements keychain-access-group entry should then be replaced with the value from the app's entitlements. Next  the app identifier prefix in keychain access group needs to be replaced with value from provisioning profile's entitlements. This is important when resigning from Enterprise to App Store.

4423,16-04-30,Issue 4423 : Snapshot run fails not finded libraries installed via pods ， Issue #4423 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description I've set up my project to use snapshot as indicated in it's github repo. So I created a new target  namel PainntUITests and added it to xcode. I managed to get the tests (and the app itself) run in my device by tapping on the "Rec" button in xcode. However  when trying to run snapshot I get an error from the compiler saying it could not find AFNetworking library  which is one of many we install via cocoa pods. I guess there's something I'm missing or not completely understanding. Any help or thought about it will be really appreciated. Complete output when running snapshot  including the stack trace and command used Mac-mini-de-lea:Painnt lea$ sudo snapshot --verbose  INFO [2016-04-29 17:22:51.71]: Fetching available simulator devices WARN [2016-04-29 17:22:51.75]: xcrun xcodebuild -list -project './Painnt.xcodeproj' INFO [2016-04-29 17:22:52.22]: Fetching available simulator devices DEBUG [2016-04-29 17:22:52.26]: Found 12 simulators.

4427,16-05-01,Issue 4427 : [Pilot] Multiple Platform Build Support/tvOS Universal Apps ， Issue #4427 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description When uploading builds to a universal tvOS app  I constantly run into the issue: pilot/lib/pilot/build_manager.rb:91:in `wait_for_processing_build': [!] undefined method `train_version' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError) When traced down I believe a contributing factor is I can submit two ipas  with the same build number  version and app id in order for it to be a universal app on the App Store. Currently Pilot only filters for processing builds with the App Version  Build Number and App Id  but it should also be filtering builds by platform  which is available in each respective build data. Another contributing issue to this could be that when I run: bundle exec pilot builds Not all of my builds show. For example here is the iTunes Connect Data and the respective pilot output: It looks as though the pilot list command is only showing one of the build trains which in this case is the tvOS one. When I currently encounter the above issue it is when I try to upload the iOS version so I am wondering if it is because pilot is only recognizing the tvOS build train.,0

Today  it's segfaulting  without any changes to fastlane config or .travis.yml. It's because Travis updated their xcode7.3 image to use ruby-2.0.0-p648 by default. I haven't tested this locally  but switching Travis back to use 2.0.0-p643 (the build it was using yesterday) fixed the problem. Unfortunately  I don't have more time to dig into this right but I do have a workaround: add this to .travis.yml: rvm:   - 2.0.0-p643 Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used ?[0Ktravis_time:start:0487f038 ?[0K$ fastlane test  /Users/travis/build/MyOrgName/MyAppname/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/json-1.8.3/lib/json/ext/parser.bundle: [BUG] Segmentation

4642,16-05-13,Issue 4642 : Specific order of profiles required in some cases when resigning binary with extension ， Issue #4642 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub This issue resides within resign.sh. Let's say I have a binary Experiments.ipa with the bundle identifier com.company.experiments. Within this app I have an extension called AudioPlugin  which has the bundle identifier com.company.experiments.AudioPlugin. I also have a profile Experiments.mobileprovision that has a wildcard bundle identifier  and a profile for the extension called AudioPlugin.mobileprovision with a bundle identifier that is the same as the extension. In order to resign Experiments.ipa  I run the following: sigh resign --signing_identity "iPhone Distribution: Company Pty Ltd" --provisioning_profile Experiments.mobileprovision --provisioning_profile com.company.experiments.AudioPlugin=AudioPlugin.mobileprovision  This doesn't work: the extension is signed with Experiments.mobileprovision because somewhere within resign.sh the wildcard identifier is matched to the extension. However  changing the order of the two --provisioning_profile flags values works as expected. I feel that this should either be fixed so that a profile that exactly matched a bundle identifier will be used even if there is a wildcard profile available. Or  this issue should be clearly documented so other developers are aware that the profile order determines precedence,0

4673,16-05-16,Issue 4673 : frameit requires a PSD to be in the devices folder to run ， Issue #4673 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version (1.89.0) I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Frameit will not run unless there¨s a PSD file in the devices folder. This is a pain when you already have converted the PSD files and don¨t want to keep them around (to save space + to keep the directory neater). Enhancement request Check for existence of one or more PNGs instead and continue with framing if they¨re found. Workaround In the meanwhile  here¨s a one-pixel PSD and the corresponding PNG that will skip the PSD check without your having to have all the Apple PSDs in the directory: skip-device-installation.zip,0
4674,16-05-16,Issue 4674 : Deliver has issues handling filenames with multiple seperators. ， Issue #4674 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Deliver has issues parsing certain filenames with multiple file separators. One example of a file name it can't understand is this: 1_watch_1.Slack for iOS Upload-1.png.jpeg It instead interprets this as: 1_watch_1.Slack This means it can't find the file and throws an error due to not being able to figure out the MIME type. Usually your screenshots would be named better than this however when deliver was set up it downloaded the existing iTunes screenshots with their original filenames which caused more issues. As a workaround I simply removed the original filename from the file name however Fastlane didn't understand the "jpeg" file extension  upon renaming it to "jpg" it worked. So to recap: Deliver should be able to handle complex file names like "1_watch_1.Slack for iOS Upload-1.png.jpeg" Deliver should be able to understand the "jpeg" file extension. Perhaps another issue could be opened to make deliver download existing screenshots with sensible names "1_watch_1.jpeg" rather than "1_watch_1.Slack for iOS Upload-1.png.jpeg" Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used Unknown content-type for file ./fastlane/screenshots/en-au/1_watch_1.slack for ios upload-1.png.jpeg  Configuration Files Isn't a issue with the Fastfile Environment fastlane version (run fastlane -v): 1..87.0 Do you use bundler to execute fastlane (i.e. bundle exec fastlane)? no Do you use a Ruby environment manager (e.g. chruby  rbenv  rvm)?

4695,16-05-17,Issue 4695 : match git_branch option not found ， Issue #4695 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I used Match to manager our certifications . And I need to use different git branch for each team .I find the following note in the readme file. match was designed to use a separate git branch per Apple account. If you work in multiple teams  make sure to set the git_branch parameter to a unique value per team. From there  match will automatically create and use the specified branch for you. More information on codesigning.guide So I added a option git_branch in my Matchfile git_url "git@privategit.com:client/certifications.git"  git_branch "v-client"  type "development" # The default type  can be: appstore  adhoc or development   force_for_new_devices true  But when I ran match development  I got the following error:   Could not find option 'git_branch' in the list of available options:    git_url  type  app_identifier  username keychain_name  readonly  team_id     team_name  verbose  force  shallow_clone  workspace    force_for_new_devices  skip_docs  my environment : fastlane version : 1.89.0 match version : 0.5.0 So how can I make the git_branch option to work.,0

No Proposed Fix Usually  when using Gradle directly with properties  they are surrounded with double quotes to prevent those kind of errors. Example : gradlew "-PRELEASE_NOTE=Release note test" clean app:assembleRelease app:crashlyticsUploadDistributionRelease Quick fix : Line 38 of https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/gradle.rb flags << params[:properties].map { |k  v| "-P#{k}=#{v}" }.join(' ') unless params[:properties].nil? should become flags << params[:properties].map { |k  v| "'-P#{k}=#{v}'" }.join(' ') unless params[:properties].nil? Ideally  we should also unescape single quotes in k and v to prevent any errors.,0

Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used This is the JacocoGradleAction run script:  def self.run(params)         flavor = params[:flavor]         build_type = params[:build_type]          gradle_task = ["test"  flavor  build_type  "UnitTestCoverage"].join          Fastlane::Actions::GradleAction.run(task: gradle_task)          Actions.lane_context[SharedValues::JACOCO_BUILD_TYPE] = build_type if build_type         Actions.lane_context[SharedValues::JACOCO_FLAVOR] = flavor if flavor       end And the action script is invoked by desc "Generate reports"   lane :reports do     #gradle(task: "testReleaseUnitTestCoverage")     jacoco_gradle(build_type: "Release")   end /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/actions/gradle.rb:29:in `join': [!] no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError)     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/actions/gradle.rb:29:in `run'     from /Users/simonvergauwen/appfoundry/Android-Fastlane/fastlane/actions/jacoco_gradle.rb:15:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:177:in `block (2 levels) in execute_action'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/actions/actions_helper.rb:35:in `execute_action'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:162:in `block in execute_action'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:161:in `chdir'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:161:in `execute_action'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:109:in `trigger_action_by_name'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/fast_file.rb:140:in `method_missing'     from Fastfile:60:in `block (2 levels) in parsing_binding'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/lane.rb:33:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/lane.rb:33:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:50:in `block in execute'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:46:in `chdir'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:46:in `execute'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/lane_manager.rb:46:in `cruise_lane'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/command_line_handler.rb:30:in `handle'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:42:in `block (2 levels) in run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/command.rb:153:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/runner.rb:428:in `run_active_command'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane_core-0.43.5/lib/fastlane_core/ui/fastlane_runner.rb:26:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.3.5/lib/commander/delegates.rb:15:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:175:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:13:in `start'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/lib/fastlane/cli_tools_distributor.rb:47:in `take_off'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.89.0/bin/fastlane:5:in `<top (required)>'     from /usr/local/bin/fastlane:23:in `load'     from /usr/local/bin/fastlane:23:in `<main>',0

4798,16-05-24,Issue 4798 : [Match] "Could not install WWDR certificate" in Travis-CI ， Issue #4798 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description After upgrading to latest fastlane having a regression with match 0.6.0 when it tries to setup a new WWDR certificate (see output below). This is a very destructive way of doing keychain things  you know. I'd like to have an option to fix this automatically rather than fail right before installing my own certificates  guys. Travis installed the new WWDR itself  and I don't have this issue since fastlane 1.66.0 (see #1989  related issue is still opened btw). Having a broken CI right now  what should I do to fix this?

4823,16-05-24,Issue 4823 : Exporting iOS app archive replaces embedded provisioning profile with older version ， Issue #4823 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description I¨m using match to manage provisioning profiles and have set up the Xcode project to use the sigh environment variables to select the correct profile. Building the app works fine and looking at the embedded.mobileprovision file inside the app in the Xcode archive generated by running match + gym  I?can see that the correct (latest) profile was used. However  when the IPA is exported by gym using xcodebuild -exportArchive  the embedded.mobileprovision inside the IPA is replaced with another older version of the profile with the same name ("match AdHoc appid") that is installed on the system. I can reproduce this by manually running the archive step on the same xcarchive like this: /usr/bin/xcrun /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/gym-1.6.3/lib/assets/wrap_xcodebuild/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive -exportOptionsPlist 'path/to/gym_config.plist' -archivePath 'path/to/My App.xcarchive' -exportPath 'path/to/gym_output'  I read that with Xcode 7 exportArchive should be using the profile from the archive  but that does not seem to be the case here. Since the provisioning_profile_path is no longer supported  I don¨t see another option to tell exportArchive which profile to use. Deleting the older profile from my system resolves the issue. This seems to be more of an Xcode issue  but I was hoping for possible pointers on how to best resolve this short of manually deleting the match provisioning profiles from the system before running fastlane.

4866,16-05-27,Issue 4866 : Match fails to import certificates when using a fully-qualified path to the keychain ， Issue #4866 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description In match/lib/match/utils.rb there's a hard-coded path to ~/Library/Keychains prepended to the keychain "name". fastlane/match/lib/match/utils.rb Line 4 in 5dff30d command = "security import #{item_path.shellescape} -k ~/Library/Keychains/#{keychain.shellescape}" When using a fully-specified path to the keychain  for example using Jenkins' "Keychains and Provisioning Profiles" plugin  the path ends up getting augmented incorrectly. A sanitized example from my project: security import /var/folders/t4/99vplf817qs40m8tz1tkkj500000gn/T/d20160526-57929-19soscm/certs/distribution/xxxx.cer -k ~/Library/Keychains//Users/user/.jenkins-slave/workspace/iOS\ Parameterized\ Build/jenkins_match.keychain -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security&> /dev/null  FastlaneCore::CertChecker can handle this situation correctly  so perhaps some similar techniques can be applied to the match implementation to fix this. It would also be nice to avoid sending output from the import process to /dev/null  at least when running in verbose mode. That would make the failure easier to see. Possibly related to #4826,1

4914,16-05-31,Issue 4914 : Pilot fails immediately when waiting for itunes to process the build and an error occurs ， Issue #4914 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Pilot immediately gives up when waiting for itunes connect to process the build encountering an error (e.g. 404 response from itunes connect; happens a lot). Combined with a CI system that retries failed builds automatically this leads to the same build uploaded multiple times. My proposal is that pilot retries failed requests after uploading the build.

4946,16-06-02,Issue 4946 : Match Keychain issues with Xcode Server ， Issue #4946 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Seems like there is an error being caused because Match can't install a certificate into the keychain. The user Xcode Server runs under (_xcsbuildd) doesn't have access to the login keychain. I manually created a new keychain (Fastlane.keychain) to see if that would solve the issue  but that did not. This had been working previously. I have recently updated to a more recent version of fastlane  and also updated to the latest version of OS X and OS X Server.

4990,16-06-03,Issue 4990 : Deliver crashes due to permission errors on seemingly temporary file ， Issue #4990 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Deliver fails to upload an app icon due to permission problems on /tmp/57a31fdfb5a257b606d6b0cbcd9a4532.png.

Our Xcode project has ENABLE_BITCODE = YES Our gym settings have include_bitcode: false The resultant xcodebuild command says set -o pipefail && xcodebuild -workspace './MYAPPLICATION.xcworkspace' -scheme 'MYAPPLICATION' -configuration 'Release' -sdk 'iphoneos' -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -archivePath '/Users/travis/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2016-06-07/MYAPPLICATION_2c1f96f 2016-06-07 06.30.33.xcarchive' clean archive CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY='iPhone Distribution: MYCOMPANY  Inc.' | tee /Users/travis/Library/Logs/gym/MYCOMPANY-MYCOMPANY.log | xcpretty?  There is no -uploadBitcode 'false' as an xcodebuild exportOptionsPlist parameter  as I would expect according to xcodebuild --help So  I'm not sure what the include_bitcode parameter of gym is actually trying to do. Result is that we have __hidden#xxx__ symbols in our dSYMs that are uploaded to iTunes Connect. Before our experiments with bitcode uploading  we did not encounter hidden symbols.

5049,16-06-08,Issue 5049 : [Pilot] - Error uploading non-bitcode enabled app to iTunes Connect. ， Issue #5049 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description As of the first week of June  Pilot has been failing the upload to iTunes command with an error consistent with the error one would see by leaving the "include bitcode" option checked when an app is not bitcode compliant. Worth noting that I can take the build produced by Fastlane and manually upload it successfully via Xcode using Organizer and unchecking "include bitcode". I am of course unfamiliar with the implementation details of Pilot  but it would appear from the surface that the ability of Pilot to automatically handle the appropriate "checked state" of "include bitcode" either stopped working - or is not up to date with the changes rolled out to iTunes Connect last week.

In that case the main app target needs to be looked up  something like this (I'm not a Ruby programmer...) main_target = xcproj.targets.find { |t| t.name == project_name } main_target_uuid = main_target && main_target.uuid if main_target_uuid   # add to TargetAttributes with the uuid as the key and DevelopmentTeam inside end I realize that this is due to limitations in the xcodeproj gem  and I've submitted a sister issue there  but they have over 30 open issues so it's not likely that there will be a quick solution on their side. For now  I'll do my own gsub on the project file and avoid update_project_team... thanks!,0

5379,16-07-13,Issue 5379 : Match: Regenerate Profile if Profile is Invalid or Expired ， Issue #5379 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Hi   Cert and Profile been synced to Git Repo using Match ( Started from scratch after nuke )   After that Generated a new Push Certificate for an existing App Id using pem ( Enable Push Services )  Existing Provisioning Profile became invalid.    When i run match without force      It is not regenerating the Profile - But it says Profile is valid   When i run match with force     Ideally a new Provisioning profile is created and synced to the git repo   To me it looks like When we run match     We need to Check whether the Profile is Invalid or Expired    If so - need to re generate the Profile and Update the Git repo  Any thoughts on this?  Thanks in advance. Ram.,0

Everything worked a week or two ago  but the past two days I have been receiving an error when it tries to distribute new build to testers. I use gym to generate the IPA  then pass that IPA to pilot. The upload works fine  internal testing works fine. It's just when it goes to send the build external users it fails. Testflight is setup correctly  beta review is already complete. If I manually add the build to external users  it goes live w/o any issues  no beta review required (as it is not a new version number).

I use fastlane to manage cross platform builds  so having two platforms in the same fastfile is very useful.

And I have tried the same flow with the latest stuff  same result: fastlane 1.99.0 scan 0.10.1 https://travis-ci.org/wkoszek/sensorama-ios/builds/149673251,0
5669,16-08-10,Issue 5669 : [sigh] Embedded mobileprovision in framework bundles is not updated while resigning ， Issue #5669 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description When using PROVISIONING_PROFILE option for xcodebuild command  an embedded.mobileprovision is added to all dynamic frameworks. In my case I'm using CocoaPods with use_frameworks! configuration option. With PROVISIONING_PROFILE xcodebuild -workspace MyProject.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -configuration Release PROVISIONING_PROFILE="my-profile-UUID"  So when "Embed Pods Frameworks" build phase is running  I can see embedded.mobileprovision present in all frameworks  e.g. building file list ... done SVProgressHUD.framework/ SVProgressHUD.framework/Info.plist SVProgressHUD.framework/embedded.mobileprovision SVProgressHUD.framework/SVProgressHUD ... SVProgressHUD.framework/_CodeSignature/ SVProgressHUD.framework/_CodeSignature/CodeResources I believe this is how xcodebuild works when PROVISIONING_PROFILE option is specified - it just embeds it into anything that has bundle ID  including frameworks. This is how it looks in the IPA: Without PROVISIONING_PROFILE xcodebuild -workspace MyProject.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -configuration Release  This time there is no provisioning profile embedded into framework. I think that's because automatic lookup finds no profile matching framework's bundle ID. How Does It Relate to Sigh? Basically  when resigning an app using sigh resign action  the embedded.mobileprovision inside .framework bundles is neither updated nor removed. So when uploading such resigned app to iTC it comes back with errors like this: ERROR ITMS-90179: "Invalid Code Signing. The executable 'Payload/MyApp.app/Frameworks/AFNetworking.framework/AFNetworking' must be signed with the certificate that is contained in the provisioning profile." After resigning  signing identity  team ID and profile UUID have changed  except for those "extra" embedded.mobileprovision inside frameworks. Suggested Fix? It does feel like Xcode is doing us a bad service by sticking that profile everywhere  on the other hand it kind of makes sense since we explicitly used PROVISIONING_PROFILE option. For the app I'm currently working on  the CI setup is a bit of legacy and I can't just rewrite scripts and get rid of that option. So I guess sigh resign could take care of this problem  i.e. remove all embedded mobile provisioning profiles from all .framework bundles before resigning them. After all  those profiles inside frameworks make no sense at all. ... waiting when we can move to Xcode 8 with signing not required any more for frameworks :) Environment cocoapods: 1.0.0 fastlane: 1.99.0 sigh: 1.6.0 bundle exec: yes rvm: yes,0
5696,16-08-11,Issue 5696 : Deliver creates default metadata/screenshot folder to ./fastlane not to ./.fastlane ， Issue #5696 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Conditions: I use fastlane from the hidden ".fastlane" folder. I use deliver from fastlane using skip_screenshots: true. I don't specify a custom path for screenshots. If I run it  deliver creates the empty screenshots folder to ./fastlane/screenshots and not to ./.fastlane/screenshots. So I will have 2 fastlane folders: ./.fastlane: with all the necessary files ./fastlane: with only the empty screenshots folder On the next run I get the following message: Could not find fastlane in current directory. Would you like to set it up? (y/n) Because fastlane thinks that it should use the - actually empty - ./fastlane folder. The error might be around here: https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/deliver/lib/deliver/detect_values.rb#L35 We might also consider not to create the screenshots folder if skip_screenshots: true.

5700,16-08-11,Issue 5700 : SimulatorZoomFix: Replace more than just whitespace characters (due to iPad Pro names) ， Issue #5700 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description An iphonesimulator device with name "iPad Pro (9.7 inch)" will (after launch) add a key SimulatorWindowLastScale-com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPad-Pro--9-7-inch-. The character replacement last modified in fastlane-old/snapshot@9f0822f only replaces whitespace. Presumptively  I was going to make a PR for・ simulator_name = simulator.name.tr(   '^' + # replace all characters except ones included below   ('a'.upto('z').to_a + 'A'.upto('Z').to_a + '0'.upto('9').to_a).join('')     "-" ) ・but  then I launched an "iPad Pro (12.9 inch)" simulator device (with Xcode 8S193k) and a key for SimulatorWindowLastScale-com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPad-Pro appeared at the bottom of the dict  so that's probably too na?ve. Todo Test older Xcode versions to see if the key for the original 12.9 inch iPad Pro has always been SimulatorWindowLastScale-com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPad-Pro. Then  I｀ll write a switch statement  based on findings. Worry about future device names・ ? See also: #5673 (comment),0

5901,16-08-26,Issue 5901 : Scan fails for Logical Unit Test Scheme ， Issue #5901 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description When passing in a Logical Unit Test Scheme into scan  it fails trying to determine the deployment target as "xcodebuild -showBuildSettings" doesn't return any values for Logical Unit Test Scheme unless the test build action is passed in. This worked until #5640 introduced the call to check the deployment target. One possible solution would be to have the FastlaneCore::Project class check the scheme type to adjust the buildaction accordingly:     def build_xcodebuild_showbuildsettings_command       # We also need to pass the workspace and scheme to this command       command = "xcodebuild -showBuildSettings #{xcodebuild_parameters.join(' ')} #{build_xcodebuild_showbuildsettings_action}"       command += " 2> /dev/null" if xcodebuild_suppress_stderr       command     end      def build_xcodebuild_showbuildsettings_action        if options[:scheme] and scheme_buildable_name.end_with?".xctest"         return "test"       else         return "build" #could also be ""       end     end     def scheme_buildable_name       #

Instead of using the UUID of the profile  it uses the team_id/profile_name. As we have different environments we need to set the name dynamically. Unfortunately sigh/match only expose the UUID as evironment variable. Fix Additionally to the UUID also expose the profile_name as environment variable,1

6058,16-09-09,Issue 6058 : Default ios_version for snapshot not sensitive to device limitations ， Issue #6058 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description iPhone 4s only supports up to iOS 9.x  while all the other device types needed for a full iTunesConnect screen size representation will work on iOS 10. For apps that support both iOS 9 and iOS 10  snapshot on the latest Xcode 8 setup doesn't succeed out of the box in a single run without creating custom simulators first. Calling snapshot reset_simulators clears everything out and reinstalls iOS 10-based simulators for most devices. This results in a case where setting ios_version '10.0' will fail on iPhone 4s  and setting ios_version '9.3' will fail on all other devices. Workaround In Xcode 8  manually create simulators for all devices for iOS 9.3  then run snapshot with the override ios_version '9.3' Configuration Files snapfile: devices([   "iPad Air"    "iPhone 4s"    "iPad Pro (12.9-inch)"    "iPhone 5"    "iPhone 6"    "iPhone 6 Plus" ])  languages([ "da"  "de-DE"  "el"  "en-AU"  "en-CA"  "en-GB"  "en-US"  "es-ES"  "fr-FR"  "it"  "ja"  "ko"  "nl"  "no"  "pt-BR"  "ru"  "sv"  "tr"  "zh-Hans"  "zh-Hant"])  scheme "Lightbow" stop_after_first_error true  output_directory "./Store/screenshots" clear_previous_screenshots true  ios_version '9.3' Environment snapshot 1.14.0  executed via just "snapshot" on the command line on macOS 10.11.6,0

6095,16-09-13,Issue 6095 : Support for App-Specific Password or something. ， Issue #6095 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist I have read the Contribution Guidelines Updated fastlane to the latest version Issue Description I have two-factor authorization on my appleID and I'm trying to work with xcode server and fastlane. So as post-trigger I've setted lane that goes throu cert sigh gym and eventually crashlytics. I'm also setting enviroment variable FASTLANE_PASSWORD. But since bot is starting this script then I can't type 6-digit code every time  that would be pointless also I would rather keep two-factor authorization. The solution should be App-Specific password  but they also not working. After contacting Apple they say that this password would work only with third-party application but with they sites will not work. So is there a propper solution for that kind of situation? Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used Log with main password #!/bin/sh  export FASTLANE_PASSWORD=MASTER_PASSWORD  cd "$XCS_SOURCE_DIR/czyPojade" /usr/local/bin/fastlane ios devBot  [14:09:31]: ?[32m-------------------------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m--- Step: Verifying required fastlane version ---?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m-------------------------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: fastlane version valid [14:09:31]: ?[32m------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m--- Step: default_platform ---?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32mDriving the lane 'ios devBot' ??[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m----------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m--- Step: set_info_plist_value ---?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m----------------------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m------------------?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m--- Step: cert ---?[0m [14:09:31]: ?[32m------------------?[0m  +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+ |                      ?[32mSummary for cert 1.4.1?[0m                      | +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | username      | blazej.wdowikowski@best-bw.pl                    | | development   | true                                             | | force         | false                                            | | team_id       | B799ALMBWW                                       | | keychain_path | /var/_xcsbuildd/Library/Keychains/login.keychain | +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+  [14:09:31]: Starting login with user 'blazej.wdowikowski@best-bw.pl' Two Factor Authentication for account 'blazej.wdowikowski@best-bw.pl' is enabled Please enter the 6 digit code:  ?[32m#######################################################################?[0m ?[32m# cert 1.4.2 is available.

6097,16-09-14,Issue 6097 : [snapshot] Simulator not reset or app not reinstalled if `ios_version` is missing ， Issue #6097 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description Without specifying ios_version in Snapfile the simulator's device_udid will not be known to erase_simulator and reinstall_app. This results in e.g. following call being made which misses the device_udid [17:19:04]: $ xcrun simctl uninstall  com.pocketlifestyle.fretello.lead.dev &> /dev/null  No error is reported and the snapshotting continues as normally. In our case the UI test however requires the app to be reinstalled and will fail at a later stage. I've already did some digging in the code and the issue seems to be with the device_udid function of the TestCommandGenerator which does not check if a ios_version is available in the config. PR with a fix will follow shortly.

6138,16-09-16,Issue 6138 : spaceship incorrectly reports "Successfully logged in to iTunes Connect" for a user who is not in iTunes Connect. ， Issue #6138 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description spaceship -u [my email] incorrectly reports "Successfully logged in to iTunes Connect" for a user who is not in iTunes Connect. When initializing a new project using fastlane init --verbose I received an "Unauthorized Access" error. During the debug process  I ran spaceship -u [my email]. This reported that it successfully logged in to iTunes Connect. See issue #6084 for more background. Within spaceship if I execute Spaceship::Tunes::Application.all I see an Unauthorized Access error  as I would expect. After some investigation  I determined that I had not been added to my company's iTunes Connect portal. After being added to iTunes Connect  Spaceship::Tunes::Application.all correctly returns the list of our applications. I have verified I am using the latest versions of fastlane and all dependencies  as well as the Xcode command-line tools. fastlane does not crash and I am able to continue with the manual steps once access fails.

6207,16-09-21,Issue 6207 : latest_testflight_build_number doesn't consider Invalid Binaries ， Issue #6207 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub OS X 10.11.6 fastlane 1.103.0 ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin15] This is not a crash and there is nothing of real value in the Fastfile  or the scripts output. This is easiest to explain as follows: The Fastfile gets the latest build number from testflight using latest_testflight_build_number. This value is 14. The value is incremented and a build is made and uploaded to testflight and we wait for apple's response. (skip_waiting_for_build_processing is not set) The whole process succeeds and a build is available for download to testers. A second build is made using the same script. The build number is now 15  but because of an Invalid Binary error during upload (Entitlements in this case)  the binary is rejected. When any subsequent builds are made  they will fail. This is because the build number will again be set to 15. The problem is that latest_testflight_build_number only considers valid binaries (or Apple only considers valid binaries when returning the build number)  and thus the script will keep trying to upload the same build number. (15 in this case),0
6219,16-09-21,Issue 6219 : "Check Dependencies" error when building with Gym : Gym bug? Xcode 8? Travis? Human error?  ， Issue #6219 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description When building on Travis CI  I continue to get "check dependencies" errors when doing builds for Fabric Beta distribution (Enterprise builds)  with 2 of the 8 dependencies reporting a problem. The problem appears to be that manual code signing choices  for example a scheme which uses "iOS Distribution" identity with "Release" configuration"  is not being respected by some subprojects (which try to sign against "iOS Development" identity  despite explicitly setting to "iOS Distribution" in the main project) Using @tmm1 's advice  I spit out the gym log and finally see something that explains the situation (see "output" below). Basically I get two errors  depending on if I explicitly set codesigning_identity in Gym. If I do not set it  gym's log says it can't find a certificate for iOS Developer on this scheme  which is true. It doesn't exist and it never existed. If I do set it  I'm told (for example) AdjustSdk has conflicting provisioning settings. AdjustSdk is automatically signed  but code signing identity <<REDACTED>> has been manually specified. Running locally (running the same Fastlane lane "do_the_beta") I do not have this mysterious certificate in my local keychain  but fastlane builds for Fabric Beta without incident locally. I don't think that certificate has ever existed before for us. The BETA scheme with RELEASE configuration is set to  and should be using  "iOS Distribution " not "iOS Development" when doing our enterprise builds for Fabric Beta. Our project contains two submodules  but most dependencies are brought into the project via git subtree. It is my understanding that these subprojects can be left as-is with "automatic codesigning" and should inherit from the parent project. So  Adjust and iOS Reachability are trying to sign with "iOS Development" (which is the default build setting for these  and really all  of the subprojects imported)  but none of the other projects in the subtree express this problem: GRMustache SocketRocket Some private SDKs MBProgressHUD I'm having a really difficult time understanding how fastlane + gym + Xcode 8 + subproject dependencies + manual code sign works together  and what needs to be set in what way. Every documentation I read seems to assume a very simple  "set the main project targets to manual code signing". I assume this means I should be able to forget about subprojects and let the build system handle those  and yet here we are. I've looked at the Build Settings for all of the subprojects. They are  indeed  set to iOS Developer in the Code Signing Identify  but this is just the default for all of them and was not altered by our team. This just "how things have always been". If the main project is set to manual code signing  and these subprojects are set to "Automatic"  should that not override any other legacy settings? Or  and this would really suck  do we have to manually manage code signing for all subprojects from now on? That wouldn't make much sense to me  because code signing identities are relative to our schemes  and our schemes are unique to our project. Subprojects would have no knowledge of that.

6264,16-09-23,Issue 6264 : runner.rb seems to be chdir'ing once extra in a rescue clause  causing a less meaningful exception ， Issue #6264 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub runner.rb recovers from an error in a clause which does a chdir into the fastlane folder by chdir'ing into the fastlane folder yet again. This is causing a backtrace that says "No such file or directory - {fastlane folder}" when that's not actually true  and thus masking the real issue. I suggest removing the Dir.chdir(path_to_use) wrapper block from the rescue clause starting on runner.rb:59. With the clause  I see this:     /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:59:in `chdir': [!] No such file or directory - ./fastlane/ (Errno::ENOENT)     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:59:in `rescue in execute'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/runner.rb:44:in `execute'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/lane_manager.rb:46:in `cruise_lane'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/command_line_handler.rb:30:in `handle'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:49:in `block (2 levels) in run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.4.0/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.4.0/lib/commander/command.rb:178:in `call'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.4.0/lib/commander/command.rb:153:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.4.0/lib/commander/runner.rb:444:in `run_active_command'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane_core-0.52.0/lib/fastlane_core/ui/fastlane_runner.rb:36:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/commander-4.4.0/lib/commander/delegates.rb:15:in `run!'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:246:in `run'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/commands_generator.rb:20:in `start'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/lib/fastlane/cli_tools_distributor.rb:58:in `take_off'     from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-1.104.0/bin/fastlane:5:in `<top (required)>'     from /usr/local/bin/fastlane:23:in `load'     from /usr/local/bin/fastlane:23:in `<main>'  This is untrue as ./fastlane/ does actually exist.

This is all strange because it worked a week ago  but that's a different issue altogether (that fastlane seems to switch the concept of pwd on me periodically  but I'm not entirely sure that's a fastlane bug yet and not somehow the fault of my configuration).,1

6278,16-09-24,Issue 6278 : update_app_identifier and update_project_provisioning both change current directory  but do not change back when done ， Issue #6278 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description If you run the update_app_identifier or the update_project_provisioning action  they change directories from ${SRCROOT}/fastlane to ${SRCROOT}  but they never change back when they are done. This causes other code that looks for files in a specific path to always fail to find the file  and fastlane fails at that point. We run fastlane on multiple apps at once in a loop  so we're running these actions multiple times per lane execution. This only started happening recently  somewhere between fastlane 1.101 and 1.104. Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used Prefer not to include  as it's sensitive.

6375,16-10-04,Issue 6375 : Match calls cert with the wrong keychain ， Issue #6375 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist [ x] Updated fastlane to the latest version [ x] I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description I have a separate keychain called "buildserver.keychain" that I use with match. I ran match nuke and wanted to recreate my certificates afterward and notices in the verbose output that match runs cert to create a new code signing identity but uses the login.keychain here. Possible workaround is to set the cert keychain using an environment variable. If you confirm this issue I can work on a PR.

6425,16-10-06,Issue 6425 : Uploading App Icon Causes iTunes Connect 500 ， Issue #6425 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description A successful fastlane release will make subsequent fastlane release fail. iTunes connect will return Error: 500 Internal Server Error. After a few minutes iTunes connect will recover. Then I can upload again. It seems like this issue happens after I added app_icon to Deliverfile. It's a iMessage sticker pack app. Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used [01:13:29]: ------------------------------------------------- [01:13:29]: --- Step: Verifying required fastlane version --- [01:13:29]: ------------------------------------------------- [01:13:29]: Your fastlane version 1.105.0 matches the minimum requirement of 1.104.0  ?

6478,16-10-10,Issue 6478 : Inconsistent ENV Variables used ， Issue #6478 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description Inconsistent environment variables are used throughout fastlane leading to duplicate entries for tools. action latest_testflight_build_number expects ITUNESCONNECT_USER Sigh expects SIGH_USERNAME Deliver expects DELIVER_USERNAME action set_changelog expect FASTLANE_USERNAME Credentials Manager expects FASTLANE_USER Produce expects DELIVER_USER or PRODUCE_USERNAME watchbuild expects FASTLANE_USER etc... Suggestion 1 Enforce standard naming of environment variables for per-tool settings {tool_name}_USERNAME {tool_name}_PASSWORD  which override any global settings  for example ITUNESCONNECT_USERNAME ITUNESCONNECT_PASSWORD (or use credential manager) MEMBERCENTER_USERNAME MEMBERCENTER_PASSWORD (or use credential manager)  or for using the same credentials for all Apple/iTunes related work FASTLANE_USERNAME FASTLANE_PASSWORD (or use credential manager)  Suggestion 2 Create documentation listing all global and tool-specific environment variables. I welcome some feedback and discussion on this.,0
6481,16-10-11,Issue 6481 : S3 upload action builds invalid URL when region is us-east-1 ， Issue #6481 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Issue Description The s3 action has a hard-coded mechanism for determining the domain for the URL it generates for the installation plist file. It assumes that if you have a region configured  it should append that region name to the subdomain  e.g. s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com for a region of us-east-1. This is a problem because the domain above is not valid  and the correct value is s3.amazonaws.com. The issue can be resolved by using the AWS SDK's internal ability to generate a valid hostname  as this pull request implements: #6344 Creating this issue post-hoc to ensure that it gets noticed :),0
6626,16-10-19,Issue 6626 : Failures due to presence of FASTLANE_PASSWORD ， Issue #6626 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description When FASTLANE_PASSWORD is present as an env var (configured on .zshrc or .bashrc) fastlane ignores the password inputed when asked on the terminal. Environment fastlane version (run fastlane -v): 1.105.2 Do you use bundler to execute fastlane (i.e. bundle exec fastlane)? Yes Do you use a Ruby environment manager (e.g. chruby  rbenv  rvm)? chruby What Xcode version do you use (e.g. 7.3  8.0) 8.0 Worth noting that this isn't the first time I've experienced this; just that being the numbnuts i am i never took the time to file an issue about this. Recently I tried on a fresh new machine at work (that I configured using my dotfiles repo which carried away the FASTLANE_PASSWORD var) and then I was faced again with a case of ?your password is wrong? even though fastlanewas asking me to input it via terminal and I was copy/pasting it from LastPass. When I was about to rage quit I realised that the variable was set and after removing it and fastlane asking me for the password again  adding the same one I used multiple times (without success) worked. Hope this is enough info to repro; if not let me know and I'll be more than happy to provide more details. PS. Thanks for the amazing work so far,0
6648,16-10-21,Issue 6648 : iTC now using "no" for Norwegian ， Issue #6648 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description We added Norwegian as app store description on iTunes Connect and downloaded the metadata. A folder no was created. However  in Xcode nn is used for Norwegian. no is an unsupported language code. So the problem is this: if you put no in the Snapfile my iOS 10 simulator runs in English  producing Englisch screenshots in the Screenshots/no folder. Thus the wrong language is uploaded. if you put nn in the Snapfile  the simulator produces Norwegian screenshots  but they end up in an Screenshots/nn folder. Since deliver is looking for the Norwegian screenshots in the wrong folder nothing is being uploaded. I suggest that for uploading no screenshots you also accept files residing in the nn folder.,0
6690,16-10-24,Issue 6690 : snapshot creates empty screenshots.html page ， Issue #6690 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I have setup snapshot  which generates 2 screenshots for me. These screenshots are generated in 2 different languages (en-US  de-DE). The screenshots are places in the folders: de-DE/ and en-US. But the screenshots.html file is always blank (white). There are some html tags written in this file  but I think the imported part is missing. This is how the current image screenshots.html looks like: <!DOCTYPE html> <html>   <head>     <title>fastlane/snapshot</title>     <meta charset="UTF-8">     <style type="text/css">       * {         font-family: "HelveticaNeue-Light"  "Helvetica Neue Light"  "Helvetica Neue"  Helvetica  Arial  "Lucida Grande"  sans-serif;         font-weight: 300;       }       .language {        }       .deviceName {         display: block;         font-size: 30px;         padding-bottom: 24px;         padding-top: 45px;       }       .screenshot {         cursor: pointer;         border: 1px #EEE solid;         z-index: 0;       }       th {         text-align: left;       }       td {         text-align: center;         min-width: 200px;       }       #overlay {         position:fixed;         top:0;         left:0;         background:rgba(0 0 0 0.8);         z-index:5;         width:100%;         height:100%;         display:none;         cursor: zoom-out;         text-align: center;       }       #imageDisplay {         height: auto;         width: auto;         z-index: 10;         cursor: pointer;       }       #imageInfo {         background: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0  0  0  0.2);         border-radius: 5px;         color: white;         margin: 20px;         padding: 10px;         position: absolute;         right: 0;         top: 0;         width: 250px;         z-index: -1;       }       #imageInfo:hover {         z-index: 20;       }     </style>   </head>   <body>             <div id="overlay">         <img id="imageDisplay" src="" alt="" />         <div id="imageInfo"></div>       </div>       <script type="text/javascript">         var overlay        = document.getElementById('overlay');         var imageDisplay   = document.getElementById('imageDisplay');         var imageInfo      = document.getElementById('imageInfo');         var screenshotLink = document.getElementsByClassName('screenshotLink');          function doClick(el) {           if (document.createEvent) {             var evObj = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'  true);             evObj.initMouseEvent("click"  false  true  window  0  0  0  0  0  false  false  false  false  0  null);             el.dispatchEvent(evObj);           } else if (document.createEventObject) { //IE             var evObj = document.createEventObject();             el.fireEvent('onclick'  evObj);           }         }          for (index = 0; index < screenshotLink.length; ++index) {           screenshotLink[index].addEventListener('click'  function(e) {             e.preventDefault();              var img = e.target;             if (e.target.tagName == 'A') {               img = e.target.children[0];             }              // beautify             var tmpImg = new Image();             tmpImg.src = img.src;             imageDisplay.style.height     = 'auto';             imageDisplay.style.width     = 'auto';             if (window.innerHeight < tmpImg.height) {               imageDisplay.style.height = document.documentElement.clientHeight+'px';             } else if (window.innerWidth < tmpImg.width) {               imageDisplay.style.width = document.documentElement.clientWidth;+'px';             } else {               imageDisplay.style.paddingTop = parseInt((window.innerHeight - tmpImg.height) / 2)+'px';             }              imageDisplay.src             = img.src;             imageDisplay.alt             = img.alt;             imageDisplay.dataset.counter = img.dataset.counter;              imageInfo.innerHTML          = '<h3>'+img.alt+'</h3>';             imageInfo.innerHTML         += decodeURI(img.src.split("/").pop());             imageInfo.innerHTML         += '<br />'+tmpImg.height+'&times;'+tmpImg.width+'px';              overlay.style.display        = "block";           });         }          imageDisplay.addEventListener('click'  function(e) {           e.stopPropagation(); // !

6818,16-11-01,Issue 6818 : Pilot : submit for external review crashes when it's currently in review or already approved ， Issue #6818 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub I'm using Pilot::BuildManager.new.distribute(config) directly in my Fastfile. Not sure if this is bad practice but it was my best way to reuse code from Pilot and not re-implement everything myself using spaceship. There's a problem with how pilot is handling the submit for external review part. Here is the current timeline of events : Submit a beta for a new build train. The call for client.submit_testflight_build_for_review! is working. However the call build_train.update_testing_status! throws an error "This build could not be used for external testing because the build is not approved." This is a valid error  however it should probably be catched in some way and shown to the user as a warning. The previous beta that was sent to review is either currently in review or approved. The call for client.submit_testflight_build_for_review! is not working and instead a error is thrown "ITC.response.error.INVALID_REQUEST" (can't submit a build to review if it's already in review) The call build_train.update_testing_status! is not called at all since an error is thrown before. Proposed solution : Add attributes in Spaceship::Tunes::Build for betaState and internalState. Current values I've seen are "inactive"  "submitForReview"  "waiting"  "active". I'm missing the in review and approved state. pilot should take into account this value to either not send the build to review  or not send to beta testers if the build is not approved. I can do a pull request. Just wanted to discuss it first.,0

7283,16-12-03,Issue 7283 : FastlaneCore::ConfigItem with data type "Array" breaks when input includes a comma ， Issue #7283 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description I have a external testers group in Testflight named "OK  Dracula: Alpha". When I try to pass this as an option to pilot add --groups  it incorrectly splits the array by the comma  ignoring the fact I've quoted my input. I'm still new to Fastlane  but it looks like the issue is this line: fastlane/fastlane_core/lib/fastlane_core/configuration/config_item.rb Line 93 in 485199c return value.split(' ') if value.kind_of?(String) return value.split(' ') if value.kind_of?(String)  That seems to be too naive an option split? What is the recommended way for ingesting an array on the command line  so that quoted input is respected as expected? I presume this also affects any other uses of array command line inputs  but I only tested from this path.

I have a folder which includes: A macbook_bg.jpg which has a macbook frame on a white background Macbook screenshots (retina pngs  2304x1440px) a framefile.json with the following:  {   "default": {     "background": "macbook_bg.jpg"      "offset": {       "offset": "+1115+595"     }   } }  Running fastlane frameit in the folder results in the following:  [15:25:06]: Using device frames version 'latest' [15:25:06]: Framing screenshot './home-01.png' [15:25:06]: Couldn't find template for screenshot type 'Apple MacBook Space Gray' [15:25:06]: Please run `fastlane frameit download_frames` to download the latest frames  Downloading new frames will result in the same error when I try it again. Is the Mac framing and framefile detection not supposed to work with a standalonefastlane frameit command? How does the offset specification work? My screens are retina resolution. Will they get placed at 1/2x the resolution automatically? Do I need to upsize the background? Thanks guys! fastlane env: ? fastlane environment ?

They're used in my Fastfile like this sonar_update_server_args = { 	project_configuration_path: "sonar-project.properties"   	sonar_runner_args:  " -Dsonar.login="+ENV['SONAR_LOGIN_TOKEN'] } sonar(sonar_update_server_args)  When I run the lane  Fastlane is logging the command it's currently executing  like shown below. This is a problem because the private tokens would show up in the public log when running this on Travis. ... [15:45:48]: ------------------------------ [15:45:48]: Driving the lane 'test' ?

8307,17-02-20,Issue 8307 : [sigh] Meaningful entitlements like com.apple.developer.associated-domains are removed while resigning ， Issue #8307 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description While resigning an app using sigh resign and --use-app-entitlements flag the logic for blacklisted keys removes some of the important keys  which should be preserved during resigning. See #8295 as an example. Reason The reason is in the order of steps during resigning. Current steps Extract entitlements from provisioning profile Extract entitlements from app binary Merge and patch profile and app entitlements together Remove blacklisted keys from patched entitlements 4.1 This is where the issue occurs - some of the keys that should be preserved are actually removed Resign Suggested steps Extract entitlements from provisioning profile Remove blacklisted keys from profile entitlements Extract entitlements from app binary Merge and patch profile and app entitlements together Resign This way we only apply filter to the provisioning profile entitlements  because this is where unwanted keys may be present. All the keys that were originally part of the app's entitlements are preserved.,0

8580,17-03-20,Issue 8580 : fastlane search_plugins key returns only results that starts from key ， Issue #8580 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist [?] Updated fastlane to the latest version [?] I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description I am not sure is it a bug or I use it wrong  but when I search  for example  changelog and expect it to return: changlelog  ci_changelog and changelog_generator. As I see it only returns those matches that starts from search query (in this case: changlelog  changelog_generator). I've tested it on different inputs. I tried to find reason of that and can't understand why it works like that in PluginFetcher it checks it like that: plugins.keep_if do |current|   current.full_name.include?(search_query) end Which should work even if search query in the middle of plugin name. P.S. Before that it does query to API with fastlane-plugin prefix + my search query. url = "https://rubygems.org/api/v1/search.json?query=#{PluginManager.plugin_prefix}#{search_query}&page=#{page}"  I think that the root of problems. Unfortunately  I have not found regex syntax documentation for that. Please advise.

8958,17-04-22,Issue 8958 : rubocop violations when using fastlane new_plugin ， Issue #8958 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist [x ] Updated fastlane to the latest version [x ] I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description A new plugin generated using fastlane new_plugin does not pass rubocop without modifying .rubocop.yml. It wants the Fastlane-generated gemspec to be snake case (fastlane_plugin_my_new_action.gemspec). It doesn't like the use of %q{} in the Fastlane-generated action. It wants an empty line after magic comments (# coding: utf-8) I've also seen complaints from the Eval Cop (eval is a security risk) because of the lines added to the Gemfile by fastlane add_plugin  but I didn't reproduce that just now. It's not hard to disable these Cops in .rubocop.yml  but it would be nice if the new_plugin command generated code that passed its own tests.

9094,17-05-07,Issue 9094 : Supply and Screengrab can create inconsistent locale directory names in Android metadata ， Issue #9094 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub ? New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I have read the Contribution Guidelines Issue Description I've noticed a discrepancy between the locale directory names that are created after running fastlane supply init and those that are created after running fastlane screengrab. This only occurs with languages that have no country code in the locale name. For example  here are the resulting directory names for each tool for an app with a Google Play listing that supports Arabic  English (GB)  German (DE) and Slovak: Language Supply Directory Name Screengrab Directory Name Arabic ar ar- English (GB) en-GB en-GB German (DE) de-DE de-DE Slovak sk sk- As you can see  the Screengrab directory names for the locales that don't contain a country code still have the dash ("-") appended to the end. This causes problems when updating existing screenshots since the original metadata that Supply created will be contained within the directory without the "-" at the end (e.g. "ar")  and any newly generated screenshots will be automatically placed in the directory with the "-" at the end (e.g. "ar-"). This inconsistency can be manually resolved  but that's not ideal if screenshots are updated with an automated job. It looks like this can be fixed by checking the country code string in the localeToDirName() in screengrab/screengrab-lib/src/main/java/tools.fastlane.screengrab/FileWritingScreenshotCallback.java:107. I'm happy to submit a PR for this fix  but I first wanted to make sure this wasn't intentional behavior  and of course I'd like the feedback of those who are more familiar with the project on whether or not I've diagnosed this issue properly.

9542,17-06-22,Issue 9542 : [match] OpenSSL 1.1.0 breaks backwards compatibility with old encrypted keys  etc ， Issue #9542 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Summary: It looks like OpenSSL 1.1.0 changed something about the default settings they use to encrypt / decrypt files. One possible work-around for this issue would be to modify match to do the following: Try to decrypt the p12 file If that fails  try it again using the older openssl behavior (by appending -md md5 to the openssl command) If that also fails  treat it like an actual failure and continue with the existing (failure) codepath. Details: Here's a stackoverflow post which describes the issue: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/344586 The default hash used by openssl enc for password-based key derivation changed in 1.1.0 to SHA256 versus MD5 in lower versions. On a box with older openssl installed  match will work correctly. You can test this by manually decrypting one of match's p12 files using this command: openssl aes-256-cbc -k password-goes-here -in ABCDE12345.p12 -out /dev/null -a -d  On a box with openssl 1.1.0+ installed  match will fail: WARN [2017-06-19 16:49:50.76]: Enter the passphrase that should be used to encrypt/decrypt your certificates WARN [2017-06-19 16:49:50.76]: This passphrase is specific per repository and will be stored in your local keychain WARN [2017-06-19 16:49:50.76]: Make sure to remember the password  as you'll need it when you run match on a different machine  [2017-06-19 16:49:50.76]: Passphrase for Git Repo: ********  [2017-06-19 16:49:54.30]: Type passphrase again: ******** bad decrypt 140736683381696:error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:crypto/evp/evp_enc.c:535: ERROR [2017-06-19 16:49:56.67]: Couldn't decrypt the repo  please make sure you enter the right password!  However  if you run the above openssl command and append -md md5 (which forces the old behavior)  it will work  you can correctly decrypt a p12 file which was encrypted using the older version of openssl. The new behavior of openssl is the equivalent of appending -md sha256.

9764,17-07-15,Issue 9764 : Empty metadata files should not overwrite iTunes Connect content ， Issue #9764 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub Use case: user has entered metadata (keywords  support/marketing urls  description  etc) directly into iTunes Connect for their app. user decides to try fastlane. Downloads  installs  reads the docs  inits for their app user does not bother with fastlane/metadata/ files  since that's already been done in Connect user ignores precheck missing data warnings. Again  that data is already in iTunes user runs the deliver command user finds all their metadata is gone  and is upset Feature Request / Fix: When a metadata file is empty  do not upload the empty contents and destroy the user's data. Instead  download any existing iTunes Connect data and write it into the empty file. Weak fixes: Add a WARNING to the preview.html at every blank metadata field warning the empty string will overwrite any existing data. Add a DATA DESTRUCTION note to precheck warnings when metadata is empty,0

In fastlane/fastlane_core/lib/fastlane_core/cert_checker.rb Lines 64 to 65 in 1240fe3 Helper.backticks("curl -o #{filename} #{url} && security import #{filename} #{keychain}"  print: FastlaneCore::Globals.verbose?) UI.user_error!("Could not install WWDR certificate") unless $?.success?   you can see that fastlane attempts to download https://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cer and install it in a keychain that the user has access to. It is assumed here that the nonzero exit status means the failure to import the certificate  but it does not account for the possibility the nonzero exit because the key already exists. I believe the error manifests now on Travis CI  because we added the WWDRCA certificate to our login keychain. See travis-ci/travis-ci#7870 (comment) for more context.

10082,17-08-18,Issue 10082 : issue template: fastlane's --capture_output includes Fastfile and other config files  which have Slack webhook URLs and other private credentials in them ， Issue #10082 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description When attaching fastlane output to an issue with --capture_output  I was surprised to find my full Fastfile in the output as well. I'm now changing a webhook URL and some S3 credentials as a result. While I understand that it's really useful to have these in the issue  it's also an information disclosure problem: there are usernames for match in our Matchfile  webhooks in the Fastfile  and other bits of private information in these files.,0

10315,17-09-13,Issue 10315 : [gym] (Xcode 9 b6) Generated exportOptionsPlist bundle identifiers contain variables instead of actual bundle identifiers ， Issue #10315 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description It seems that the generated exportOptionsPlist (attached at the end of the output section) contains unresolved variables so gym fails at the final step when archiving. The provisioning profiles are the right ones. We use xcconfigs in our project and there is where we define the bundle identifiers. It seems that these variables haven't been resolved by gym. I tried replacing the BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER variables with the correct identifiers (i.e. com.example.app) and re-run:  /usr/bin/xcrun /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fastlane-2.55.0/gym/lib/assets/wrap_xcodebuild/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive -exportOptionsPlist '/var/folders/zd/gsg8f_8d0ls5qg43wfgjt56r0000gp/T/gym_config20170912-72849-gbzp57.plist' -archivePath /Users/user/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2017-09-12/app\ 2017-09-12\ 12.25.07.xcarchive -exportPath '/var/folders/zd/gsg8f_8d0ls5qg43wfgjt56r0000gp/T/gym_output20170912-72849-1r1iwrq'   and the operation completed successfully.

I am left with no simulators at all. In the "Devices & Simulators"  iOS 11 simulators aren't even an option for download. I could go through and manually recreate all the simulators  but there has to be a better way. I re-extracted the Xcode 9 GM build from the tip file but it seems the flag for "installing additional components" is tripped so it does not download any simulators. Any thoughts on how to reinstall my simulators  including for iOS 11?

10358,17-09-19,Issue 10358 : [Regression] "no implicit conversion of nil into String" in match during cert install after updating to 2.57  ， Issue #10358 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description After updating to version 2.57 the match step now fails with the error no implicit conversion of nil into String when trying to install certificates. Running the same command in 2.56 succeeds. From the debug output it looks to be choking when installing the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority.

Resulting profile can't be used for signing as it contains wrong bundle id Similar problem described here: #8612 fastlane match development -a BUNDLEIDPREFIX.GD --git_branch V7WSJXFT7Z [12:35:03]: Get started using a Gemfile for fastlane https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/#use-a-gemfile [12:35:05]: Successfully loaded 'Matchfile' ?  +---------+----------------------------------+ |     Detected Values from './Matchfile'     | +---------+----------------------------------+ | git_url | GITURL | | type    | development                      | +---------+----------------------------------+   +-----------------------+----------------------------------+ |                 Summary for match 2.59.0                 | +-----------------------+----------------------------------+ | app_identifier        | BUNDLEIDPREFIX.GD                     | | git_branch            | V7WSJXFT7Z                       | | git_url               | GITURL | | type                  | development                      | | username              | USERNAME                   | | keychain_name         | login.keychain                   | | readonly              | false                            | | team_id               | V7WSJXFT7Z                       | | verbose               | false                            | | force                 | false                            | | skip_confirmation     | false                            | | shallow_clone         | false                            | | clone_branch_directly | false                            | | force_for_new_devices | false                            | | skip_docs             | false                            | | platform              | ios                              | +-----------------------+----------------------------------+  [12:35:05]: Cloning remote git repo...

10440,17-09-28,Issue 10440 : [Frameit] The keyword and title sometimes have a vertical offset  ， Issue #10440 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I use Frameit with pleasure to frame my screenshots and add a localised keyword and title to it. The majority of text is aligned correctly: Some of the framed screenshots show a vertical offset between the keyword and title. The offset might be a few pixels: Or massive: My Framefile: {     "default": {         "keyword": {             "font": "./fonts/SF-UI-Display-Semibold.otf"              "color": "#007AFF"         }          "title": {             "font": "./fonts/SF-UI-Display-Regular.otf"              "color": "#002955"         }          "background": "background.png"          "padding": 25          "show_complete_frame": true          "stack_title" : false     }      "data": [              {              "filter": "01"              }               {              "filter": "02"              }               {              "filter": "03"              }               {              "filter": "04"              }               {              "filter": "05"              }              ] } These are French  but I have got it in other languages too. The ones with a small offset  have a special character in either the keyword or title. For example in German the "?"  but also the apostrophe (') in a Dutch word. But I can't explain the massive offset in the example above  where no special character is used. The behaviour seems somehow random. Here are the *.strings files for the above French screenshots: keyword.strings  "01" = "Familier"; "02" = "Logos"; "03" = "Pratique"; "04" = "Glisser"; "05" = "S?lection directe";  title.strings  "01" = "en apparence"; "02" = "pour changer de cha?ne"; "03" = "pour entrer du texte"; "04" = "pour contr?ler"; "05" = "des sources";  Can you please investigate?

10579,17-10-12,Issue 10579 : [Regression] fastlane match does not read Appfile in gitlab-runner ， Issue #10579 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version ?? 2.61.0 I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description fastlane match does not read values from Appfile or Matchfile when executing in the gitlab-runner (GitLabs CI Environment) anymore. This has been the case for previous versions  at least for 2.55.0. Everything works as expected when I'm issuing the same commands locally. We provide some values using the Appfile or Matchfile but the app_identifier is passed as an cli argument (because this value is part of the CI configuration). See the following three sections for a failed attempt with 2.61.0 in the CI  a successful attempt with 2.61.0 running locally and a successful attempt with 2.55.0 running in the CI. I'm pretty sure my files are correctly set up  because everything works when executing directly.

10778,17-11-02,Issue 10778 : Adding export_options to gym not working ， Issue #10778 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Existing issue #10685 Issue Description Because of issue #10685 I manually changed 'signingStyle' to 'automatic' in the plist and exporting is working correctly then. So to achieve this via fastlane I added this in my gym command: export_options: {                 signingStyle: "automatic"         }  But when I run fastlane the signingStyle of generated plist is still 'manual'. I don't want this... Did I do anything wrong or is this een issue in fastlane?! Sorry I don't past all content of fast file etc because it contains confidential information. Please ask me if you need some specific parts to answer my question.

11017,17-11-24,Issue 11017 : [Regression] Setting env var directly bypasses verify block ， Issue #11017 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description In our Fastfile  we define ENV["GYM_OUTPUT_NAME"] = "my_build.ipa" to globally set the output name for all of our calls to gym. This value was added to our Fastfile about 9 months ago and worked fine when cutting builds. Then recently  while trying to cut a build using Xcode 9  I was running into code signing issues during the export step - after reading through existing issues and the changelog  I found the Xcode 9 changes and promptly updated fastlane (I was using an outdated version) - problem solved. However  while the code signing error went away when I tried cutting a new build after the update  a new error appeared during our upload to hockey step - I kept hitting https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/hockey.rb#L179 because hockey was returning a 415: Unsupported Media Type. After some digging  I finally realized that our build was being exported with the name my_build.ipa.ipa and was surprised  since I had seen in the source that the .ipa extension was handled in order to prevent this very thing from happening when naming the build. It seems like the proc handling the GYM_OUTPUT_NAME validation (which removes the .ipa extension if present - https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/gym/lib/gym/options.rb#L65) was being bypassed when setting ENV["GYM_OUTPUT_NAME"] directly. Instead of setting the env var  I explicitly provided a value for output_name in our call to gym  and uploading the build to hockey succeeded without error. I'm presuming this is a regression because setting GYM_OUTPUT_NAME directly has been fine for us in the past. Environment ? fastlane environment ?

11085,17-12-01,Issue 11085 : [sigh] --use_app_entitlements flag with in-app-purchases/ApplePay entitlement ， Issue #11085 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I am trying to use fastlane sigh to resign a small Apple pay demo app for testing purposes. When using the --use_app_entitlements flag  the resulting IPA crashes when trying to use the apple pay button. The issue seems to be related to permissions/entitlements. When I compare the entitlements from the original binary and the resigned one  I notce the in-app-purchases key with the corresponding merchant value is missing. This issue does not occur when not using the --use_app_entitlements flag. From my limiting understanding the blacklist that is provided in the resign.sh script removes this entitlement with the --use_app_entitlement flag. But there seems to be no real explanation as to why. The only thing I could find is a link to a buck issue regarding acceptance by the apple store. But to me it seems that this entitlement should still be in there for the app to run. Fastlane env ? fastlane environment ?

11094,17-12-02,Issue 11094 : download_dsyms action crashes when downloading from multiple iTunesConnect teams ， Issue #11094 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I am part of several different Apple Developer / iTunesConnect teams for different variations of the same(ish) app. I have a refresh_dsyms lane in my Fastfile that will connect to and download the dsyms for all my apps across all my teams. For multiple apps in the same team  this is working fine  but as soon as it switches to a different team  everything fails. I can go and manually switch the order in which the dsyms are downloaded so that a different team's apps are downloaded first and that will work for that team  so it's not a problem with a specific team  it's switching from one team to another. This lane used to work. Last time I ran it was a couple months ago  so I can't say exactly when it stopped working. Captured Output Command Used: refresh_dsyms iosVersion:1.4.0 buildNumber:406 beta:true I've edited out the sensitive information (I hope...)  but the important stuff is still there.

11252,17-12-19,Issue 11252 : import_from_git is not importing the correct version ， Issue #11252 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I've created a private repository called fastlane-lanes  which contains a bunch of lanes that I intent to use across multiple projects. However  when i try to specify which version to use using (e.g. ~> 1.0.0)  it seems that versions are sorted alphabetically  rather than by number  i.e. versions are sorted like this: 1.0.0 1.0.1 1.0.10 ?? ?? 1.0.11 ?? ?? 1.0.2 1.0.3 1.0.4 1.0.5 1.0.6 1.0.7 1.0.8 1.0.9 This causes the "newest" release to be 1.0.9 rather than 1.0.11. I do not know if this is the case for minor and major  since I did not test this. But i suspect that it works the same. I'm importing the lanes like this: import_from_git(     url: "git@github.com:my-org/fastlane-lanes.git"      version: "~> 1.0.0" )  Complete output when running fastlane  including the stack trace and command used Captured Output Command Used: install Output/Log  DEBUG [2017-12-18 16:10:07.72]: Checking if there are any plugins that should be loaded...

Since device_manager.rb is checking for next if line =~ /unavailable/ only  it counts this booted simulator as one of the "good" one and tries to get exact version for it from runtimes dictionary and ends up with com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-11-2. I can't tell exactly how did I manage to have unavailable simulator in booted state. Must be related to the fact that I have multiple Xcode versions on my laptop. The workaround using xcrun simctl shutdown Simulator-ID or xcrun simctl shutdown all is always possible  though I think Fastlane can also add some safety checks  e.g. skip whole group of unavailable devices  which may be easier after switching to --json ouptut of simctl.

As a quick workaround  we had to add to our lanes a dummy Xcode project file. We don't reference it anywhere but it is found by some global check which seems happy with it・,0

11659,18-01-23,Issue 11659 : Certificate not installed when already installed in other keychain ， Issue #11659 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I'm implementing the fastlane match action to use in our build script for Xamarin iOS builds (using terminal commands). When the certificate is not installed on the machine  this works correctly. However  if the certificate is already installed in another keychain  the certificate is not installed in the provided keychain. This is problematic: for each build  a new keychain is created and the certificate added; the keychain is removed when the build is completed. If multiple builds need the same certificate  the latter build will fail if the first build removed its keychain. The main issue is this error: security: SecKeychainItemImport: The specified item already exists in the keychain. It thinks the certificate is already installed in the keychain  while it isn't.

11700,18-01-26,Issue 11700 : [Regression] version_bump_podspec regex is broken with the introduction of swift_version in CocoaPods 1.4.0 ， Issue #11700 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description CocoaPods 1.4.0 introduced a new podspec configuration field swift_version. As the version Regex from version_bump_podspec matches "version =..." (simplified)  the Swift version is bumped instead of the Pod version. Right field to bump: spec.version Wrong field to bump: spec.swift_version Example Before version_bump_podspec(bump_type: "minor")   spec.version       = "1.2.3"   spec.swift_version = "4.0" After version_bump_podspec(bump_type: "minor")   spec.version       = "1.2.3"   spec.swift_version = "4.1.0" Expected   spec.version       = "1.3.0"   spec.swift_version = "4.0" Environment ? fastlane environment ?

I established today  having suffered this  that it returns 1 basically any time something goes wrong. This needs to change IMO it should fail with an error. Returning a bogus value is never the right action. Scenarios I verified that it returns "1": Calling latest_testflight_build_number with the incorrect team / app ID (e.g. using your enterprise count due to a default in your Appfile instead of your release team/app ID) Calling latest_testflight_build_number with an app version that has not got any TestFlight releases Other past issues have shown this also seems to happen if iTC is down or there is an API endpoint problem. Can we please get this to "raise" or similar if there is an actual problem extracting the information?,0

11721,18-01-30,Issue 11721 : deliver exports screenshots from iTC as JPEG  saves them as PNG ， Issue #11721 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description When first using deliver and it pulls down the metadata from iTC  it downloads the screenshots and saves them with a .png extension. However iTC appears to be serving JPEG images  so we end up with screenshots in JPEG format but the png extension. When deliver tries to upload these again to iTC it fails  with the confusing error message: [14:48:56]: [IMG_BAD_COLOR_SPACE] This does not use RGB color space. Please edit the image to use the RGB color space and re-save it.  The color space is in fact correct  the format (for the stated extension) is incorrect. It is unclear whether this is a fastlane/deliver bug or a change in iTC.

The workaround is to get the original PNGs again and save them over these bad images. However I notice in iTC web UI that the screenshots are displayed as JPEGs. If this is the same endpoint spaceship is using  then this would appear to be the source of the problem. It seems like quite a bad bug in that the deliver init process is no longer symmetrical - you can download but cannot upload that same data.,0

11768,18-02-02,Issue 11768 : deliver downloads `app_icon` from iTC as a JPEG  uploads as JPEG causing iTC error ， Issue #11768 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description Investigating a fix for #11724 that turns out was not "needed" (it seems iTC allows JPEG uploads of screenshots and even if they are called .png)  I found that the real problem I had was that the app icon was downloaded by deliver as a JPEG and saved as app_icon.jpg which makes some sense if iTC is serving up JPEGs these days. However when you deliver to the app store  the JPEG icon is uploaded and you get the bad colorspace crash as it seems to expect a PNG as you would hope for quality reasons. bundler: failed to load command: fastlane (/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/bin/fastlane) Spaceship::UnexpectedResponse: [!] [IMG_BAD_COLOR_SPACE] This does not use RGB color space.

This seems wrong as iTC chokes on a JPEG Aside: Interestingly it seems there is some significantly divergent asset handling in the codepath. Why are JPEG screenshots downloaded (without choking on this?) and then saved as .png  whereas the app icon is downloaded as a JPEG (should also choke on this?) and then saves as .jpg. It feels like there should be unified safe handling of this.,0
11769,18-02-02,Issue 11769 : Disallow build_app as a lane name ， Issue #11769 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I had a lane named build_app  which worked fine with older versions of fastlane  as far as I can remember. Now if I use the lane directly it works ok  but if the lane is used from another one  fastlane interprets that I'm using the build_app action and later it complains that it can't find the project path  the scheme  etc. I was very confused by this  and it took me a long time to figure out the name clashing.

11803,18-02-09,Issue 11803 : Unexpected results deploying to Android Store using "supply" with "check_superseded_tracks: true" ， Issue #11803 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist ? Updated fastlane to the latest version ? I read the Contribution Guidelines ? I read docs.fastlane.tools ? I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description When I run my android beta lane with "check_superseded_tracks" set to "true"  my production release with a lower version code is removed from the play store. When I set the flag to "false"  the production release remains untouched and published. I believe the desired result should be to remove builds in a lower task priority (Production->Beta->Alpha) and then by the version code. This could be my misunderstanding of the flag but the examples I have found all refer to a publish to the beta track dealing with the alpha track versioning. ?

Builds we upload with fastlane with the intent to distribute to a "Nightly Testers" group don't seem to be submitted for review. When logging into iTC  the builds appear as waiting for review. However  the logging seems to indicate that the distribute_build method is hit  which would normally indicate that the build would be submitted for review. Environment Using a Gemfile with fastlane 2.80.0 Lane that uploads to TestFlight is the following:   ipa_path = *redacted*   pilot(     ipa: ipa_path      distribute_external: false      skip_waiting_for_build_processing: options[:skip_waiting_for_build_processing]  <- false     wait_for_uploaded_build: true      changelog: "Bug fixes"      beta_app_description: "Nightly Build"      beta_app_feedback_email: "redacted@redacted.com"      groups: ["Nightly Testers"])  I'm wondering what's the best way to debug this? Should I open up a PR that adds some more logging around this part of the code? Has anyone had this issue on 2.80.0?,0

11858,18-02-16,Issue 11858 : Couldn't decrypt the repo when using swift in syncCodeSigning ， Issue #11858 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I have been using fastlane for some months and have correctly setup match for code signing. Now I'm trying to upgrate to the new swift language feature so I'm "translating" the ruby script to be in swift and use the FastlaneRunner with the generated xcode project and so. The issue I'm having is that when running the syncCodeSigning function it throws an error saying that the password is wrong when i'm sure it is correct. Then I run plain 'fastlane run match' and introduce the same params when asked (git url  password) and it successfully decrypts the certificates and everything works fine. The only difference I can see is that one is run from old-way ruby and the other is from swift and goes through all the RubyCommand.Argument stuff. When using old-way ruby it works and when using swift it doesn't.,0

Meaning  when the last build was 4 but failed due to error "There was an error importing this build."  it return the build number 3. This  after incrementing the build number to latest_testflight_build_number + 1  makes my pilot command fail with the error: "Redundant Binary Upload. There already exists a binary upload with build '4' for version '3.1.7'" The lane latest_testflight_build_number should return the latest build number no matter the state it is at. In my case  it should return 4 and not 3.

11905,18-02-23,Issue 11905 : Cannot get groups for multiple apps in same Spaceship session ， Issue #11905 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description I'm running commands directly in Spaceship to fetch the group for each app_id we have in iTunes Connect. We have 44 apps now and we do login once first: Spaceship::Tunes.login Then for each app_identifier in iTunes Connect we do the following commands to fetch groups: app = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.find(app_identifier) external_group = Spaceship::TestFlight::Group.all(app_id: app.apple_id) The output from this call is fine for the 1st app: [<Spaceship::TestFlight::Group         id="5f486262-bb82-43ab-afb3-5838e85e029a"          name="ITC.apps.tf.labels.internalTesters"          is_default_external_group=false          is_internal_group=true          provider_id=369xxx          is_active=true          created="2017-05-28T02:05:28.266+0000"          app_id=11xxxxxxxx>  <Spaceship::TestFlight::Group         id="b413ffa1-77cd-47d2-9413-2bc1ccexxxxx"          name="ITC.apps.tf.labels.CustomGroup1"          is_default_external_group=true          is_internal_group=false          provider_id=369783          is_active=true          created="2017-05-28T02:05:28.273+0000"          app_id=11xxxxxxxx>]  But when we do this again with a new app_identifier: app = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.find(app_identifier2) external_group = Spaceship::TestFlight::Group.all(app_id: app.apple_id) We get the exact same result. Looking at the source code for test_flight/client.rb  I can see that the function get_groups(app_id: nil) for getting groups does the followingreturn @cached_groups if @cached_groups. And I cannot see any way to reset the cache. How can I get around this or reset the cache so I can get groups for more than one app in a Test Flight session?

12081,18-03-18,Issue 12081 : upload_symbols_to_crashlytics action fails on unzip errors ， Issue #12081 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description For some of my projects with bitcode support iTunes Connect provides archived dSYMs which cannot be unzipped properly  at least it seems like that. Every time upload_symbols_to_crashlytics tries to invoke unzip command it fails with invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 error message  but  in fact  some of the dSYMs were actually unzipped. However  since unzip returns an error code instead of 0 sh action throws an error  so none of those successfully unzipped dSYMs are going to be uploaded. I've ran some tests in terminal with unzip -qo and manually downloaded dSYMs  just to make sure this is not the problem of download_dsyms or any other part of Fastlane. So  my question is: could we add some kind of fail_on_unzip_errors parameter which will be set to true by default to upload_symbols_to_crashlytics action and wrap Actions.sh("unzip -qo #{current_path.shellescape}") with begin/rescue block? Something like this: begin   Actions.sh("unzip -qo #{current_path.shellescape}") rescue => ex   UI.user_error!(ex.to_s) if params[:fail_on_unzip_errors] end Maybe there is a better way to workaround the problem I have  but It would be better if upload_symbols_to_crashlytics could handle such situations by itself.

12132,18-03-22,Issue 12132 : Upload to Crashlytics plugin has no way to disable Firebase plist upload ， Issue #12132 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description Recently  UploadSymbolsToCrashlyticsAction was updated to support the relatively new feature of uploading symbols to Fabric using a GoogleServices plist file (#11798). While this is listed as an optional setting  if there is a GoogleServices.plist file anywhere in the directory structure  the action will now attempt to upload using the plist. Unfortunately  this causes problems in multi-organization scenarios for Fabric. Firebase doesn't currently support having different configurations within the same app (to support things like enterprise versions or internal versions)  so there is only one plist file. At the same time  uploading to Fabric with the plist overrides any value used for the Fabric App ID. What this results in is that the dSYM files can be uploaded to the wrong Fabric Organization  which will result in crashes being unable to be symbolicated. This action should be update to truly make the GoogleServices plist optional and not pull it in automatically if found. We have created a workaround by replicating the previous version of the UploadSymbolsToCrashlyticsAction as a local action and using the local action instead of the real action  but we would prefer using the official action  if possible.,1

12337,18-04-19,Issue 12337 : Some usages of list-keychains clobber the list of keychains ， Issue #12337 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description Resign and replace_keychain_in_search_list call security list-keychains -s KEYCHAIN which removes all keychains from the list of keychains except the keychain passed as a parameter. add_keychain_to_search_list correctly appends the keychain passed as parameter onto the existing list of keychains. This was causing some issues with our deployment machines since we have some keychains that need to stick around outside of fastlane,0
12442,18-05-03,Issue 12442 : invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 when importing XLIFF files containing non UTF8 characters ， Issue #12442 ， fastlane/fastlane ， GitHub ? New Issue Checklist Updated fastlane to the latest version I read the Contribution Guidelines I read docs.fastlane.tools I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description When updating our XLIFF files  fastlane try to output in the console a warning from xcodebuild which could include an non UTF8 character. It looks the bugs is around that method which try to format the output properly (CRLF + colors): def command_output(message)       actual = (message.split("\r").last || "") # as clearing the line will remove the `>` and the time stamp       message.split("\n").each do |msg|         if FastlaneCore::Env.truthy?("FASTLANE_DISABLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT")           log.info(msg)         else           prefix = msg.include?("?") ? "" : "? "           log.info(prefix + "" + msg.magenta)         end       end     end  Expected: It should not break  and should be more bulletproof against command outputs ? Thank you !
