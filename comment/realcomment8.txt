389. bug report number : ['1231']
comment number: 5599793 
body: You are misunderstanding what that code does.

Can you give a series of RPC commands that shows the bug?  setaccount associates a bitcoin address with an account, it we removed the "Detect when changing..." code as you suggest then you get situations where one address is associated with TWO accounts, which is wrong.
 

comment number: 5642077 
body: Here's series of actions to demonstrate the problem:
1. Create address: http://vvcap.net/db/ig2jMMXnX1MTPybtAFM7.htp
2. Now the customer paid for the item, and we want to rename account: http://vvcap.net/db/FKIoM_-Rvt4LXqBcp9a1.htp
3. We get this: http://vvcap.net/db/go58vwdQsVlfVXqxz2N3.htp . This is the EXPECTED behavior, the one I want to reproduce using XMLRPC.
4. I rename account back: http://vvcap.net/db/NthP4EtVkOgKaOhpkCQj.htp
5. Now I do the same thing using bitcoind, which uses same xlmrpc: http://vvcap.net/db/kxooAA7LiRhaa0ktxOBF.htp
6. EXPECTED: old address is replaced with "----> 02. Customer Actually Paid" and not kept anywhere else in the address book

On 3.x versions, after that command, I have been getting address renamed, but "----> 01..." one relocated to a new. Same behavior I saw on another client, which I downloaded ~ 20-ish April 2012. I think it was 0.6.1, but maybe 0.6.0. According to the timestamps 0.6.1 didn't exist at this time, so maybe I'm imagining things. I did not take screenshots, and cannot reproduce it anymore.

I retested now on all 0.6 versions and following are results:

0.6.0 does not rename at all
0.6.1 and 0.6.2 work as expected

so I guess the bug is fixed. I have no idea why did I see that problem previously but not now. Since problem is not reproducibnle, I am closing the bug I guess.
 

comment number: 5642541 
body: Okay, I reproduced the problem. I was apparently renaming outgoing address, when bug is affecting receiving address. Here's how it goes:
1. Start position: http://vvcap.net/db/MUThlEUsdjSUl1uhdqaW.htp
2. Rename using daemon: http://vvcap.net/db/vWiLAQcDBlZc-recHldI.htp
3. Get this: http://vvcap.net/db/9KAeMv31O700xXl91mqx.htp

So, instead of renaming the address, setaccount relocated label to another address.

Client version is here:  http://vvcap.net/db/8SgEs2t3RfMcJ_jD7UlM.htp
 

comment number: 5672596 
body: not "instead", btw.
As I see on [3] — it renamed addres fine, but _also_ (not instead) it moved "----> 1" to another one (does it? doesn't you?)

Btw, I remember something like that on very-very-very old bitcoin-qt releases, when it created new addresses every time I tried to rename existing, but than @laanwj fixed this.

So, I guess, it is GUI-related bug (like it was on bitcoin-qt before moving it to main tree).
 

comment number: 5990161 
body: @msva You are right. What I was trying to say is that expected behavior is that account gets renamed and nothing else. Instead of that account gets renamed AND an old label gets relocated. The code that does it is located in RPC, at function `Value setaccount(const Array& params, bool fHelp)`, so it affects both GUI and daemon, and I saw this code in every incarnation of bitcoin client RPC.

What makes this bug extra annoying is that essentially it makes impossible to get rid of the label once it is in the database, unless you use GUI.

Is it possible to get this addressed anytime soon? I'm so tired of having to recompile client every time a new version comes out.
 

comment number: 6305302 
body: @msva, that bug was related to the "default address" (vchDefault). Indeed, the default address is no longer used or updated when QT_GUI is set.

The problem here is that the "account system" is slightly different from the UI labels. It doesn't allow removing all addresses from an account, which is intended behavior not a bug. We cannot change this as programs might be relying on this.

Maybe there should be a command to delete an account and move all its addresses to the "" label.
 

comment number: 32023149 
body: We're not going to touch the accounts for the foreseeable future.
It is not even sure if the future wallet implementation will have such a feature at all.
If you want anything else than the current state, it is recommended to build your own ledger system on top.

comment number: 5127347 
body: It is unfortunate that AlreadyHave() is called in a loop, implying a lot of lock/release in a row (even if it is likely cached and uncontended).

If LOCK() is moved outside AlreadyHave() and above its callers' loops, that reduces lock/release to one, but holds the lock for MSG_BLOCK in addition to MSG_TX.
 

comment number: 5129131 
body: How long do the loops run on average/worst-case? Is the runtime of the loops that enclose AlreadyHave dependent on I/O such as network/database?

It looks like AlreadyHave runs very fast (just some hash lookups), however the enclosing loops contains network calls such as PushMessage. I suppose it is undesirable to hold the lock during those?

In that case the current solution is best. It is also the best encapsulation.
 

comment number: 5179288 
body: ACK. If there is a performance problem arises for the processing of "inv" messages, we can always move the lock to a pre-processing step that filters the received inv list before further processing.

I was sure tcatm was some sort of... script used by the team to retrieve translations and that it was a shorthand for Transifex CATalogue Manager. Uh-oh...

Line-wrapping sounds like a good intermediate idea until we get rid of the thing.

comment number: 15835196

401. bug report number : ['1063']
comment number: 5022458 
body: 1) I think it's a pity that Qt doesn't break off long tooltip messages itself. How the hell are we (and translators) supposed to know how wide text gets rendered and what will, and will not run off the screen.

2) Yes, that was forgotten when it was added.
 

comment number: 5109913 
body: The recommended way to fix this appears to be to add `<qt/>` in front of the message to make sure Qt interprets it as rich text instead of plaintext, and can apply its own formatting algorithm. It would be preferable to do this automatically for all tooltips. I'd loathe having to track this individually for every translated message in every language.

Edit: Looking at the Qt source, I think this could be implemented globally by listening for `QEvent::ToolTipChange` events, then rewriting the messages to prefix `<qt/>`  _if it is not yet rich text_. See also:
- http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7/qt.html#mightBeRichText
- http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7/eventsandfilters.html
 

comment number: 5111670 
body: @laanwj I think it could also be done by replacing \n with a HTML-br as this is what's done for the lock symbol in the client, if the wallet is encrypted and / or unlocked ... that tooltip seems to be rich text already, right? I think there are only 2-4 places at all, where HTML-tags are used directly in the strings. Your idea seems cleaner, so we would only have to remove the current br-Tags (the ones for bold text should remain).
 

comment number: 5112066 
body: Yes, you are right, the programmatically generated tooltips will also have to be generated as rich text. `\n` will not do anything for formatting in rich text messages. If custom line breaks are desired, `<br>` should be used.
 

comment number: 6670388 
body: _<quote>then rewriting the tooltips to prefix `<qt/>` if it is not yet rich text.</quote>_
You sure that is works? On my side `<qt/>` is displayed as plain text and there are no line breaks, so apparently the content of the tool tip is considered as plain text rather than rich text. Here's an example with revision 5fa8396 on Ubuntu 10.04.4 with GNOME 2.30:

> Can this be solved somehow by shortening the translated strings or is french a language of natively long strings :)?

Yes, French sentences are in average longer than... well, most other
languages, which makes them good candidates as placeholders (and for
headaches when one translates Android apps).

I could shorten the translated strings a bit but they would look kind of
weird (the equivalent of Show QR Code would become just QR Code,
"Nouvelle Adresse" would become "Nouv. Adresse"). That said, note that
in version 0.6.3, the problem also occurs with English sentences, so
IMHO the best way to fix the issue is to modify the geometry of the
window (i.e. increase its width).

Interestingly, I grabbed the tarball of revision 5fa8396 from github and
compiled it, and then I was surprised to see that the issue seemed to
have been fixed... until I realized I hadn't enabled QR Code support
with qmake. In short, with one less button, things look much better so
increasing the width of the window should do the trick.

PS: As described on #1064 a very similar problem also occurs with the
splash screen image. A slightly bigger image appended to the bug report
fixes the problem, so you may want to commit it until the splash screen
is disabled entirely (rev 5fa8396 still has it).

IIRC I noticed nothing else with a similar problem when I was clicking
frantically on every option Bitcoin has in order to test the French and
Turkish translations; otherwise I believe I would have reported them
too. I couldn't find anything else with a quick test now either :)

comment number: 5010172 
body: Probably. It is the only place in the source where rand() is used.
 

comment number: 5010188 
body: I see it in commented code in main.cpp too:

```
    //while (rand() % 3 == 0)
    //    mapNext[pindex->pprev].push_back(pindex);
```

I wonder if perhaps it's deliberate, because the wallet rand() code is in a tight loop and we don't want to exhaust our entropy source.
 

comment number: 5010717 
body: That loop execute a great many times— a proper cryptographically secure RNG is probably going to be noticeably slow here.   If it is, then would anyone object to using a fast PRNG seeded by RandBytes at the start of the function?

In general I don't think there is a big privacy concern here— even knowing the random sequence completely shouldn't matter unless you also know the inputs under consideration.
 

comment number: 5021913 
body: @gmaxwell also, rand() is not thread-safe according to its man page, using rand_r(*seed) is recommended in that case is as it has explicit state. 

If there is no privacy concern here, a simple solution would be using rand_r with the state (just one int) generated at the beginning of the function with GetRandInt(). 
 

comment number: 31083130 
body: We don't use rand() anymore but our own insecure_rand() for non-security-critical randomness that does get seeded. Closing this.

I've tried killing my bitcoin directory and reloading all the blocks, even under different versions of bitcoin. I do have a backup prior to all of this from jan (it must have been after I encrypted my wallet) but that one has the same issue which is strange since it was backed up on a different computer (not running bitcoin) and hasnt been modified since then.

I've looked around at issue 955 and 711, ran bitcointools but it didnt complain about anything. I've even tried using the backup-ed wallet and bitcointools new wallet on another machine and it still crashes. 

I tried using the -upgradewallet switch, same issue (Log shows "performing wallet upgrade to 60000). The problem also happens if i try to change my passphrase.

Any suggestions?
 

comment number: 4957633 
body: Update: I found the right pass it looks like the crash was being caused on an incorrect pass.

Using 0.6.0.6-beta trying (incorrect-password1) when attempting to send coins or change passwords the client crashes. Because of this I figured it was the correct password due to other incorrect passwords not causing the client to crash (they would just cause the client to report incorrect pass).

Figuring that one or more of the keys were corrupted sipa gave me two custom clients. 

first patched client
http://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-gc8bd77b/ (404'd now I guess you should ask him if you really need it)
When this was run with -recovery flag it checks all keys at decryption time and ignores the faulty ones, so if you use the wrong pass it wont have any funds since the decryption will fail. This tried to use a key that was removed (when i stupidly was using the wrong pass at this point) since it doesnt prevent the coin mechanism from choosing those coins or update the balance.

second patched client
http://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-g694cc14/
again you run this with -recovery from the cli or it will just be the same as 0.6.0.6-beta I believe. Using this patch it reports in the debug output which keys were removed because of which reason, and should update the balance. So if you use the wrong pass decryption will fail and the balance will show 0.00.

After writing down all permutations of what my pass could be I found the correct passphrase and the released 0.6.0.6-beta client works as expected. I'll email the empty wallet to gmaxwell and hopefully he can figure out why the wrong pass causes it to crash.

Assuming QTimer works correctly, I think the problem must lie in TransactionTablePriv::updateWallet
 

comment number: 4654591 
body: DecomposeTransaction (and associated function showTransaction) decide whether transactions are visible or not in the UI:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/transactionrecord.cpp

It might have something to do with the block chain depth check that happens there. Maybe if a coinbase transaction is rejected the first time, it is not added later on when the chain advances. 
 

comment number: 4672185 
body: Eligius payouts are coinbase transactions right?
 

comment number: 4673747 
body: Right, though as I mentioned, I'm pretty sure I've seen this occur with non-generation too.
 

comment number: 4680487 
body: If you don't trust the QTimer you may be interested in this commit in my sandbox, it removes the timers and updates the transaction list / address book when asked to by the core. Also fixes the problem that address created through rpc don't appear in the ui.

comment number: 5710476

comment number: 5710675

body: @luke-jr should probably update the version string
 

comment number: 4684718 
body: Are you sure you're running 0.5.3.1?
 

comment number: 4684754 
body: Is it possible you are still running 0.4.0? Bitcoin-Qt doesn't delete the old wxBitcoin client...
 

comment number: 4684761 
body: Actually, 0.5.3.1 does not have a "Help/About" menu, only a "Help/About Bitcoin-Qt" menu...
 

comment number: 4685478 
body: I am using 0.5.3.1. I downloaded the Windows binary installer from the bitcoin website and upgraded my earlier version 0.5.1 which also reported 0.4.0-Beta. And yes there is a Help>About on the main menu on the main screen. Here is exactly what it says:

comment number: 4685508 
body: If the menu entry is called "About", and not "About Bitcoin-Qt", you are most certainly running a 0.4.x version.

Probably the old binary (bitcoin.exe) was not removed when you upgraded to a newer one (where the binary is called bitcoin-qt.exe), and you still have shortcuts to the old one?
 

comment number: 4685661 
body: sipa:

You are right! The shortcut was wrong, pointing to bitcoin.exe. And there is a bitcion.exe still there in addition to the bitcoin-qt.exe. So does this still qualify as a bug? Since the installer did not correctly delete the old exe and update the shortcuts?? :-D
 

comment number: 4685674 
body: Is there any reason that I should not delete the old bitcoin.exe under c:\Program Files\bitcoin\?
 

comment number: 4685702 
body: Also, seems like the olde UI provided more useful information about connections/transaction/#BTC all on one page than the new UI does. :-|
 

comment number: 4686284 
body: I thought that bug was fixed, though now that I look at setup.nsi, it doesnt look like it... :(

Is there any reason that I should not delete the old bitcoin.exe under c:\Program Files\bitcoin\? <-- no

Also, seems like the olde UI provided more useful information about connections/transaction/#BTC all on one page than the new UI does. :-| <-- common complaint, but the old ui was written in an unsupported development version of wx, and since we had no wx programmers at the time (still dont), it was decided that moving to a much better supported toolkit was much more important than minor UI gripes.  Also, a new UI design is in the works, likely to be released as a part of 0.7, see http://188.138.99.157/stuff/qtvert17.png (still a WIP)
 

comment number: 4695908 
body: We need to teach the 0.6 setup.nsi to remove the old wx .exe and shortcuts.
 

comment number: 4703123 
body: @TheBlueMatt For the new GUI, is it possible to make the last bar in the "connection-quality" symbol green ... I did never understand, why it's more like yellow (and am no graphics artist ^^).
 

comment number: 4766116 
body: The 0.6rc5 setup.nsi removes the old wx .exe, and shortcuts are overwritten, so this is fixed.

You can still shoot yourself in the foot if file permissions are wrong (e.g. install bitcoin as administrator, then install a new version without admin rights), but I think the answer to that is "Don't do that!"

You guys have seen this issue before

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/711

Also I tried Pywallet.py to dump the keys, but I'm getting "wrong password" on all the passwords tried
 

comment number: 4586347 
body: Which bitcoin version?
 

comment number: 4586819 
body: was using 0.4.0,  I updated to 0.5.3.1-beta and I'm still getting the crash.
 

comment number: 4600671 
body: What about 0.6 RC4, does this work? Are there any special characters in the password?
 

comment number: 4600768 
body: Thanks for the quick replies everyone.  

I'll give 0.6 RC4 a go.   There are no special characters in the password.   The password is 7 alpha numeric characters,  the first 5 characters are letters with the first letter being uppercase and the last two characters are just numbers.  
 

comment number: 4600899

comment number: 4616311 
body: That function initializes the EC_KEY object embedded in a CKey to have a given (32-byte) secret (CSecret). In your case that function is called with an empty CSecret, which shouldn't happen.
 

comment number: 4619521

comment number: 4630950 
body: I wish I understood this a bit more.  Sorry for all the simple questions, but I'm really curious about how this class works and where the corruption happened.

I used Fairdell HxCmp to do a byte comparison of   2 known good encrypted wallets and  then I compared a good encrypted wallet to my bad encrypted wallet.

Start at offset 4200,   the bad wallet is all 00 00 00    the good wallet has data at this location.  The 2 good wallets have data at this location as can be seen in Image #1 of the photo Album located below.  

Data starts to re-appear again at offset 6000.   I'm not sure if any of this helps to make sense of this.

The Photo Album can be found here.   http://imgur.com/a/DhC8Z#0
 

comment number: 4696012 
body: Consensus is this is a "we don't know how it happened but somehow the bits on your disk are not what they should be" problem that we can't reproduce.

I moved the priority from high to medium, and removed the 0.6.0 milestone from this issue, but I think the only fix for problems like these will be a much better scheme for backing up and restoring wallets.

412. bug report number : ['945']
comment number: 4554290 
body: Thanks for noticing. There isn't supposed to be HTML there in the first place, QT creator must have added it.
 

comment number: 4554330 
body: No problem, even small glitches are worth to get discovered and fixed, to produce a "perfect" product :). Some other parts of the code contain HTML-tags for writing bold or to do a line break, is this supported and can be used in translations for text layout?

Example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/locale/bitcoin_en.ts#L180
 

comment number: 4554484 
body: Yes, it's fine to have &lt;b> or &lt;i> etc, but there should be no html/body headers, or font changes to fonts only present on one Linux distribution :)

The only problem with fixing this is that all translations have to be changed too.
 

comment number: 4554682 
body: There are 32 language files, so yes it's a bit work. But what would be the cleanest way to do this, update main file (english), do an lupdate, push to Transifex, let translators do their jobs? And how does the fixed string look like? I will update the german translation as soon as it's possible to do it ... perhaps I can help in fixing the other languages, too (not translation wise, but only to get rid of the HTML mess).

I hope someone can finally do that magic "lupdate", so all strings can be translated (see issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/940).
 

comment number: 4554704 
body: If we want translators to do it, we have to wait at least until after the final 0.6.0 release, otherwise "Wallet" will remain untranslated for a lot of languages in the coming release.

I'd prefer changing them all at once (either manually or with a script), but I don't have any experience with the transifex syncing and don't want to mess it up. Transifex is leading so it should be changed there first, before it goes to git.
 

comment number: 4554761 
body: I guess tcatm (Nils Schneider) could help, as I don't know how to proceed from here, too. Any idea how to point him to this issue ;)?

From the documentation:

Source file
src/qt/locale/bitcoin_en.ts is a treated in a special way. It is used as the source for all other translations. Whenever a string in the code is change this file must be updated to reflect those changes. Usually, this can be accomplished by running lupdate
 

comment number: 4569968 
body: Well I think best solution would be really to do this after 0.6, to have a sufficient time window for all translations to get updated.
 

comment number: 4749902 
body: Could someone set the milestone to 0.7 for this, as the word "Wallet" will need to get re-translated, which should be possible very early in the 0.7 development.

And someone needs to fix it, by removing the HTML part completely ... I could do that, but I'm not sure, about the font settings for this specific translations. If it only needs to be "Wallet" without anything, I will open a commit.
 

comment number: 4797550 
body: I'd still prefer one person to update all the translations in this case. It is a pretty trivial (even programmatic) operation, which will be the same for every language. Indeed, just strip the HTML so it says "Wallet". Let's not bother the translators with it, who might also get it wrong.

And yes this ACK for 0.7.
 

comment number: 4797742 
body: There is a font formatting used for "Wallet" (size 11 and it looks bold). This would add tags into overviewpage.ui instead of the HTML code. Is this okay or how is the default for setting that stuff for a label, if not in the designer.
 

comment number: 5525708 
body: As #945 got merged, we now need to update the en master file in our master branch.
 

comment number: 5651019 
body: Fixed and the new master file containing this change is in Transifex -> close!
 

413. bug report number : ['944']
comment number: 4553067 
body: To usefully debug this issue, we need function names/line numbers from those addresses in [backtrace]. I think you find these out this using the addr2line command and the (debug) executable.
 

comment number: 4554691 
body: Function names/line numbers will help.  I can also try to reproduce this running under 'valgrind' -- can you tell me what operating system you're running on and send me the output of:

```
grep 'method=' ~/.bitcoin/debug.log | tail -500
```

... so we have an idea of what RPC calls might be triggering the bug?
 

comment number: 4557093 
body: Hi Gavin,

I will do that, but it takes time to reproduce the error, I appears that it depends o the wallet being used.

once I reproduce the error  I will send you the output of:

grep 'method=' ~/.bitcoin/debug.log | tail -500

Wladimir suggested using addr2line, and it is on my system, however I have never used it before, but I can give it a try.

It was compiled on a debian 64 bit system version 6.0, the compile was done statically, since the goal was to use it on a Centos 64 bit version 5.5, the errors occurs when running on Centos, I have not tried to reproduced the error under debian, but I could try.
The reason it was not compiled on Centos directly was that Centos is supplied  with an incomplete openssl that has missing code such as ecc, not only that even though boost, and openssl compile just fine under centos, too many errros in regards to those libraries are trigered at compile time, in centos the bigger problem is ssl, that is why it is compiled under debian statically.

The bug only triggers with moderate or heavy use, it does not trigger under light use.

As soon as I have the debug information that you need, I will send it to you.

Thanks,

Sergio Riveros

If I can be of any further help to troubleshoot this bug please let me know,
I have a feeling that it relates somehow to the wallet, since with a clean new wallet this proble does not occur.

Sincerely,

Seems that it happens after Base64 decoding (called from HTTPAuthorized), when constructing the string from char array. Doesn't help us much, I'm afraid... some time before this allocation the heap got corrupted. This could be in Base64Decode itself, or before that...

comment number: 4162790 
body: More research into what's going on:

boost::interprocess is busy-waiting (at low priority), because it is emulating Posix functionality.
See the comment is in boost/interprocess/detail/workaround.hpp  :
     //Mac Os X >= Leopard defines _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED but does not seems to work.

... or google for "osx _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED"

I'm still thinking about the best way to workaround this; having Bitcoin-Qt use 100% cpu whenever running will trigger too many bug reports to release it the way it is.

comment number: 4211787 
body: hi sipa, i tried his method but didnt help. because my wallet is encrypted it doesnt want to recover/repair it. when i was doing his method i could see my privatkeys and transactions and even my account public keys. his methode gave me an error something like error restoring wallet. do you have any other methods?
thx in advance
 

comment number: 4214361 
body: First, this will only work if you used the encrypt wallet function of 0.6.0rc1.
Second, make a backup.
- Run: db4.8_dump -p wallet.dat >wallet.txt (to create a human readable wallet dump)
- Open wallet.txt using your favorite text editor.
- Search for lines starting with "\03key". There should only be a few of them.
- Delete those \03key lines, as well as the 1 line that follows each.
- Now search for lines starting with "\04pool". There should be +- 100.
- Delete those \04pool lines, as well as the 1 line that follows each.
- Import the purged dump again: db4.8_load -f wallet.txt wallet.dat.new
- Replace wallet.dat with wallet.dat.new, and start bitcoin.
 

comment number: 4218734 
body: Hi sipa,

I'm windows user and im at work right now, hence this delayed response ; )
just installed Ubuntu and db4.8 utils.. 
got the human readable wallet.dat 

im just confused now as I have only one \03key!\03,, and its [junk tail] been found in three different places. One its own \03key!\03 line
second in a paragraph with lots of other JUNKS, and third as you said in a \04ckey\04 line,

 Ihave deleted the \03key\03 line and the \04ckey\04 line..
the paragraph between those lines I have left it..

from my Ubuntu I could not use db4.8_import command, so I used db4.8_load -f command.

when I restored the wallet.dat and started the bitcoin. it crashed.. "c++ runtime failure.. " any idea?

here is my wallet.txt junk..

 \03key!\03\b7\\06\f7'\c5\c5\98\c3\8c\11\06z\1e\0e\c3\9d\b0\e4TO\be\ee

ive tried all of those you mentioned... somehow it doesn't want to load the wallet

i have deleted the 03key.. but ont the secret key junk,
than deleted 04keypool it was arnd 100 lines.. i deleted those aswell.

still when i load the bitcoin it gives c++ distribution failed message.. 

this seems suspicious for me..

419. bug report number : ['879']
comment number: 4072494 
body: Adding -rt should be done only for Linux, I suppose? It's strange that we'd have to link against it directly, as we don't use `shm_open`/`shm_unlink` directly, it is at most Boost using it.
 

comment number: 4072524 
body: When trying to understand the change I found a link:
  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnderstandingDSOLinkChange
that claims to explain it.

Hope that helps!
 

comment number: 4072631 
body: The undefined symbol is referenced on line 374 of /usr/include/boost/interprocess/shared_memory_object.hpp,
included by /usr/include/boost/interprocess/ipc/message_queue.hpp,
included by bitcoin/src/qt/qtipcserver.cpp
 

comment number: 4072793 
body: Yes, that makes it fully clear. We must link to -lrt on Linux, as previously we were using it indirectly through some other lib and that's no longer allowed...
 

comment number: 4493004 
body: On Fedora You fix help too.
 

comment number: 4493025 
body: Is that some kind of a stack-based language?

Does changing "LIBS += -lssl -lcrypto -ldb_cxx$$BDB_LIB_SUFFIX" to "LIBS += -lssl -lcrypto -ldb_cxx$$BDB_LIB_SUFFIX -lrt" in bitcoin-qt.pro fix it on Fedora?
 

comment number: 4493085 
body: Fixed now.
 

420. bug report number : ['877']
comment number: 4061347 
body: Installing an older version of growl (1.2.2) seemed to fix this.

http://growl.info/downloads
 

comment number: 4064069 
body: We probably shouldnt depend on growl to be installed though...
 

comment number: 4145019 
body: Could this have something to do with the USE_DBUS compilation option? I suspect that might make Bitcoin use Growl on the Mac to get Dbus-like functionality (for what, I'm not sure...).

And I might have (accidentally) compiled the 0.5.2 release with USE_DBUS=1.
 

comment number: 4204926 
body: Well it doesn't depend on Growl - there is a trick in place which involves using AppleScript to call it and Bitcoin-Qt does check for Growl on startup.

You can easily fix this error by choosing the plain Growl.app (the GrowlHelperApp has been included into it). I could probably find out the Growl version and fix the call script appropriately.
 

comment number: 4222328 
body: @p2k : I'd like to get this resolved before the final 0.6 release, or at least suggest a workaround in the release notes.  What do you mean by "choosing the plain Growl.app" ?  Choose where?
 

comment number: 4256360 
body: @gavinandresen He means that right before the app crashes, it pops up a dialog box (http://cl.ly/2c0O0m0m3A090V2J2Y0R)

But it didn't work for me. I chose Growl.app but it still crashed.
I haven't found a fix that isn't just "install the old version of Growl".
 

comment number: 4451201 
body: Ok, I finally got some time for this. Can you please keep your old version of Growl and check for backwards-compatibility? Can't downgrade Growl on my office Mac.

https://github.com/p2k/bitcoin

EDIT: I'm not sure how to make a proper pull request now. If I try, 3 commits are listed: my old one about macdeployqtplus, the merge commit of me, and the new one about the bugfix...
 

comment number: 4600833 
body: I cherry-picked p2k's commit after testing this on my 10.6.8 Mac first without and then with Growl 1.2.2.

comment number: 4174593 
body: I don't get this. It can only come from:

```
text = tr("%n second(s) ago","",secs);
```

However, this is a valid usage according to http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/linguist-programmers.html .

And I can't reproduce the problem either...

Edit: Ah, this happens when secs is smaller than 0. Interesting.

comment number: 18804835 
body: @BoltBlit You did not set rescan=false when importing?
 

comment number: 18804995 
body: @sipa To clarify: I tried again w/ another key and rescan=true.  After import, the address shows up in the 'Addresses' pane, but not the 'Receive' pane.  After a restart, the address is no longer in the the 'Addresses' pane, but then does show up in the 'Receive' pane.  The behavior is kind of confusing.
 

comment number: 22553088 
body: If make import from debug console, then it moving from 'Addresses' to 'Receive' after repeating this action.
In debug log it presents as NotifyAddressBookChanged with isMine=0 at first time, and as isMine=1 at second.
 

comment number: 39520087 
body: This issue can be closed. It is fixed with 0.9 because we assign address purposes now.

The problem was we relied on isMine to determine whether to show as "sending" or "receiving".
And when importing, it was not mine (yet). But after the next refresh of addresstablemodel is was mine. (See comment above by r000n)

Also see #3831.

Re: Version 0.6 release candidate 1
Today at 08:23:41 AM

Yesterday my pc crashed for no aparent reason (just  went like what seemed to be standby, then after 10 seconds rebooted). When i started bitcoin client it took about 2-3 minutes to load before the gui popped up.
After the gui shows it just freezes, can't click anything, task manager claims it's not responding, also RPC doesnt reply to commands.

I did a chkdsk but all seems fine there...

Also, all seems good when reverting back to 0.5.2.

Can't really explain it or reproduce the crash exactly, all i know is that 0.6rc1 now freezes whenever i start it. Used to work just fine before.
 

comment number: 4243678 
body: I have got the same problem here, so count me in :).
 

comment number: 4248806 
body: did you try this.. rename your %appdata%\BitCoin > bitCoin_Original
start BitCoin tool ( yes fresh with new wallet.dat)
once it started, terminate bitcoin tool,
copy the old wallet.dat to the newly created bitcoin. check the result..

if you stil have the same error something bad with wallet.dat might want to take your wallet.dat under the loop.
 

comment number: 4253425 
body: I created a new data folder, but had the "old" wallet.dat in from the beginning ... that did not fix it. I don't want to re-download the whole blockchain again to try your idea, so which file needs to be in the new data folder to skip that step?
 

comment number: 4256810 
body: @krishKM Even an empty data folder instantly freezes the GUI, so currently not fixable for me ... waiting for RC2.
 

comment number: 4257759 
body: so you deleted everyrhing inc. wallet.dat and it freezes? 1. are u using any of development software from microsoft? (visual studio)1. did u uninstall any software recently?3.what os?  Sent from Samsung Mobile
 

comment number: 4258356 
body: The folder was empty, nothing in it and yes the GUI freezes, but background threads seem to work, because there were the normal files created and for example the blockchain download was working, because the folder grew in size. I don't use any MS development software, but there are lot's of C++ runtimes installed, that come from different products, tools and which is quite normal. I don't recall, which or if I recently removed any software, sorry. OS is Win7 x64 SP1.
 

comment number: 4259163 
body: aha... can u please reinstall c++ 2008 runtime and check?
 

comment number: 4260111 
body: Uninstalled every C++ 2008 runtime I had on my system and now have only 9.0.30729 + 9.0.30729.6161 (which is a security update) C++ 2008 x86 runtime installed. Did not help, GUI freezes.
 

comment number: 4261050 
body: do you actually see _NOT RESPONDING_ MESSAGE on the gui title bar?
you said its working in background. check your activex settings. 
best idea to test ur local activex setting, creating new user and install bitcointool and check
 

comment number: 4261893 
body: Right, it shows "not responding" and stays in this state and that's what I called GUI freeze.
What has Bitcoin to do with ActiveX?
 

comment number: 4282529 
body: Same problem with RC2, so I started an in depth investigation and used Sysinternals Procmon.exe for this. I wanted to know which files or registry keys the client processes and one folder came to my attention.

C:\ProgramData\boost_interprocess\Select LastBootUpTime from Win32_OperatingSystem

This one contained 2 files, 1 which consisted of 32 "random" characters and looks like a hash and a BitcoinURL file of size 0. The files were still there after "killing" the client!

I'm working in IT, so call it luck or experience ... I deleted the whole C:\ProgramData\boost_interprocess folder, restarted the client, removed the database logs from the datadir and now everything works again :)! After I shutdown 0.6 RC2 these files disappear, so perhaps the former bluescreen with 0.6 RC1 made these files persistent, which freezes GUI after a Client re-start, because these 2 files can not be written to. I'm not sure, if 0.5.2 had this files, too ... so perhaps that's why 0.5.2 always worked!

Perhaps others should try this and perhaps this one is solved. But can any developer shed some light in here, what these folder or files have to do with the BC client?
 

comment number: 4553105 
body: I think boost_interprocess was hanging due to stale files (I'm not sure what IPC mechanism it uses on windows). It is used to pass URLs to an already-running bitcoin-qt.exe, and did not exist yet on 0.5.0.
 

comment number: 4572094 
body: Is there any error checking code in the client, which could inform a user about the stale files and give a short how-to to fix the issue? That would remove the need to add code, which deletes files on Windows.

The problem still persists, as I observed it once more after a bluescreen with RC4.
 

comment number: 4624703 
body: Closing, dup of #956
 

427. bug report number : ['824']
comment number: 35893984 
body: So in principle we should be calling read (which has the "return all or error" semantic), not read_some.

431. bug report number : ['814']
comment number: 3888552 
body: Probably caused by the network stack refactor, it shows everything (even IPv4 addresses) as IPv6 now?
 

comment number: 3899281 
body: I just tried running v0.6rc1 on a PC that WAS using a proxy and it replaced my valid proxy address details with the IPv6 looking address.
 

comment number: 3919823 
body: The UI gets the string representation of the proxy address in this way:

```
return QVariant(QString::fromStdString(addrProxy.ToStringIP()));
```

... which returns either a IPv4 address or IPv6 address string, based on the return value of isIPv4(). An address is identified as IPv4 if it starts with `0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:FFFF` (IPv4 Mapped address). I see nothing wrong in the logic here.

This does not explain how the garbage value ended up in the proxy option in the wallet, though. And I'm unable to reproduce this. Could there be a backward compatibility issue in the serialized representation of addresses? @sipa?

Some experimentation did uncover another problem: the input field takes only IPv4 addresses

Edit: He is _not_ using the proxy. Theoretically, the setting should still be at the default (127.0.0.1:9050), or at least what he left it at last time.
 

comment number: 4043535 
body: Not sure how this is possible. Does the problem still exist?
 

comment number: 4051675 
body: I just tried deleting my wallet.dat and let v0.6rc1 create a new wallet and the proxy address was ok (127.0.0.1:9050).  However when I copied back my original v0.5.2 wallet and reran v0.6rc1 the proxy address was garbage again.

My wallet file is the same wallet file that was generated by the v0.3.2 client a year ago.
 

comment number: 4144894 
body: This is definitely an issue, I just tested by:
- Ran bitcoin 0.4 on a testnet-in-a-box datadir, set the Use Proxy and Proxy address to 127.0.0.2

comment number: 3991533

comment number: 3991753

comment number: 3991811 
body: No users should not have seen a problem going from 0.4 to 0.5.X because of the upgrade (it just means that you cant go back without manually deleting the logs).  Your issue is a simple case of log corruption, it happens all the time.
 

comment number: 3991909 
body: But then again, why is 0.6 RC1 sensitive about a corrupted log and 0.5.1 is not? If the log is corrupt, it should not be readable with any of the two bitcoin-qt versions.

comment number: 4606241 
body: I'm going to use this comment to keep track of my investigations into this bug.  I'm running different versions of Bitcoin in a virtual machine, and seeing what version of BDB they write.

Command to dump out the BDB version:

```
od -j12 -N8 -tx4 ~/.bitcoin/testnet/database/log.000*
```

gives:

```
0000014 00040988 0000000f
# 0x040988 is the bdb magic number
# 0x0f is the version
```

Results (last hex value on first line is the version):

Bitcoin 0.3.24 : 0x0e     (db4.7)
Bitcoin 0.4.0 :   0x0f      (db4.8)
Bitcoin 0.5.3 : 0x0f
Bitcoin 0.6.0rc1 : 0x0f
Bitcoin 0.6.0rc4 : 0x0f

BUT: If I compile and link on Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit VM:
 : 0x10
On my mac:
 : 0x10
... both of which are also bdb 4.8.  I'm confused; are there two versions of 4.8 with incompatible log file formats?

Bitcoin 0.4.1 is able to work with everything in my `~/.bitcoin` dir. 0.5.4rc3 and 0.6.0 do _not_ work (both report `Error loading wallet.dat: Wallet corrupted`).

comment number: 3791086 
body: Does #766 fix it?
 

comment number: 3791194 
body: Haven't tried #766.  Test setup is:

3 testnet-in-a-box nodes, with node 1 sending fuzzed transactions to 2.
Node 3 is listening in and CPU mining.

valgrind doesn't complain about uninitialized vars (you have to compile openssl and bdb specially to make valgrind not trip on them), and getmininginfo returns reasonable info at first.

But it is reproducible, pooledtx goes wacky after a while.
 

comment number: 3791285

comment number: 3885544 
body: In the dup I just closed I noticed that the pooledtx went crazy around the same time as a new block was found.
 

comment number: 3886177 
body: The 'crazy' number 18446744073709551613 is in fact just -3 printed as an unsigned 64 bit int.

The bug is caused by CTransaction::RemoveFromMemoryPool() doing --nPooledTx for every transaction in the newly found block whether or not it was in our memory pool or not.

CBlock::SetBestChain does this:
        // Delete redundant memory transactions
        BOOST_FOREACH(CTransaction& tx, vtx)
            tx.RemoveFromMemoryPool();

and CTransaction::RemoveFromMemoryPool() doesn't check whether we have each transaction or not - it erase()s it anyway, and decrements the counter.
 

comment number: 6032353 
body: How often does it happen that it tried to remove a transaction that wasn't in the memory pool?
 

comment number: 6032372 
body: It doesn't.  My change comment was sloppy.
 

comment number: 6032393 
body: oh... what would have been the unsloppy comment?
 

comment number: 6032608 
body: "Only _attempt to_ remove transactions from memory pool when [...]" would be better.

When a new block is found, the code was attempting to remove each of the transactions in the block from the memory pool of pending transactions.  This would quietly succeed, doing nothing, for transactions which weren't in the memory pool, but it was decrementing the pool size counter even if it didn't remove the transaction, leading to the pool size counter wrapping around to a huge value.

So my change checks to see if each transaction is in the memory pool before attempting to remove it from the pool.
 

comment number: 6032751 
body: ah, thanks. now I understand. I guess this could be a location in the code where I could make a patch that restricts relaying blocks that are not including free transactions. I think it would be good to give this option to full node operators who aren't mining. So far various patches have been included that help raise mining fees. Such a patch would help to encourage miners to include free txs thereby lowering mining fees. I believe it should be down to the node operators to decide/vote on mining fees rather than the developers. I suspect that the value of bitcoin could be affected by such a change. Perhaps the more mining fees go up, the higher the value of a bitcoin increases too? If so, that would explain a motivation for the developers (who probably own substantial bitcoins) to see the mining fees increase.
 

comment number: 6032857 
body: This isn't the place to discuss the issue.

I would suggest making a thread in the development board here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0 to discuss it.

[ But I doubt reducing mining fees from their currently very low level would have any impact on the value of bitcoins. A concern is that unless transaction fees increase to match the falling rewards for mining, many miners will stop mining, leaving the network more vulnerable to attack. ]

comment number: 3263824 
body: The bitcoin protocol only exchanges peer addresses as IPs, isn't it?

Does it ever connect to a hostname instead of an IP? (only for seeding maybe?) If so, it indeed should do this directly through SOCKS, and not by first looking up the name using DNS, as this exposes the host name to anyone listening for DNS requests.

Edit: DNS lookups _should_ be only used when `-dns` is passed (which sets `fAllowDNS`). In practice, it always does DNS lookups for showmyip.com etc when determining the external IP address, and when lookup up the IRC server (!) irc.lfnet.org.
 

comment number: 3426157 
body: This is half real half bogus, — the warning is generated because of the assumption that if the socks port is seeing IP addresses the client did its own DNS requests which have leaked out.  (e.g. lots of apps can be configured to use a proxy but still end up using the libc resolver and then deanonymizing data leaks out via DNS, tor can't see the leak but it can see connections to IPs instead of names)
For the most part we don't use DNS— the exceptions being the stuff mentioned above and DNSSeed which can't be usefully done using tor's integrated dns (see the other issue I opened on dnsseed+tor). 
We should make sure to use dns via tor for the things where we do dns and disable showmyip when using tor (dnsseed is now disabled already)
Unfortunately that warning will remain, but after those things are fixed the warning will be completely bogus and I don't think there is anything we can do about that. :(

body: I am on the MAC OSX 10.7.2 LION

The passphrase seem to work if I create a new bitcoin folder in version 0.4/0.5

Problem is the original dat file was created since early client 0.3

Durning one of the migration to each version I was having a bug when I get a new transaction, the client would automatically generate a new bitcoin address by it's own (I believe it was client 0.4 before I input passphrase). This was fixed after I input passphrase.

I still have the files from 0.4 after I input the passphrase, this seems to be the point where everything started.  I get the EXCEPTION error still when i load up the files.

body: Hmm, it seems you have one (or more) private key(s) that are somehow corrupted.  I would recommend moving any and all coins in the wallet to a fresh wallet.  If you can provide more info on when/how corruption might have happened and on exactly which versions, it would be appreciated.
 

comment number: 3196409 
body: My wallet file is encrypted is there anyway to decrypt the file so I can move out all my bitcoins?  I can't use the client since every time I enter in the right passphrase the client crashes.
 

comment number: 3196436 
body: Ah, well now thats a problem...do you not have a wallet file backup?
 

comment number: 3196484 
body: I've looked a bit at the source, and it seems this error is thrown when your wallet contains an invalid secret key. It discovers this only after you enter the passphrase as the secret keys are encrypted.

As BlueMatt says, this is probably a result of wallet corruption. Fixing this issue will require a special-purpose script, or (easier) restoring a backup...
 

comment number: 3196595 
body: I really wish I had a backup pre-passphrase wallet.dat file.  It didn't dawn on me till I tried to use some of the coins.  I really want to recover those coins since it took me like 7 months of work on a slow machine.
 

comment number: 3196653 
body: I'll see if I can write a branch to work around that error sometime in the next couple days if I have time
 

comment number: 3196739 
body: I appreciate all the help I can get.  I did a google search for my error and it seems like there was one other instance of the same error.

I would donate to the cause, but I would need to wait till I can get some BT on my new wallet file.
 

comment number: 3196759 
body: Heh, well I havent looked at that particular code in a while, but (IIRC) it shouldnt be too hard to just ignore the error and keep loading the wallet to avoid the client crashing so you can get some of your coins back...
 

comment number: 3262423 
body: I think "ignoring the error" isn't good enough.  If my wallet is corrupt, then I really want to know about it; maybe my hard disk is going bad and it is time to buy a new machine.

But just throwing an uncaught exception as bitcoin does now is definitely the WRONG thing to do. Lets brainstorm a little on the best way to fix it:

First, it seems to me telling the user should be told that their wallet file is corrupted.
Then maybe: give the user a choice: exit Bitcoin (they can restore from a good backup), or try to recover.

I'd like to see a "Try to Recover" that took a "first, do no harm" approach and did something like:
- Closed/renamed the existing wallet.dat
- Rewrote a new wallet.dat, skipping all 'tx' records and any un-serializable or un-decryptable records
- Re-scanned to recreate transaction history
- Gave the user a report on whether or not any keys could not be recovered

... although maybe all that would be better implemented as a separate tool or "re-run bitcoin with the -fixwallet switch."

For a quick-and-dirty fix for yellowcoin, maybe a pair of new command-line args:   -fixwallet=fixedwallet.dat -walletpassphrase=foo  ... that did a read/unencrypt/re-encrypt/write and skipped anything that didn't unserialize or decrypt properly...

And "we" should generate some nicely corrupted testnet-in-a-box wallets to make sure it works...  (bitcointools should be handy for that).
 

comment number: 3262532 
body: Yes, switching from "fatal errors" to "ignore errors" is not a good thing. I think BlueMatt was only proposing to do that as a fixup for yellowcoin's specific case.

The first step for proper error handling would be to restore the dialog box when a fatal exception occurs, instead of silently exiting to the console (so catch uncaught exceptions, maybe log them somewhere as well).

A full recovery function would be even better, but is also more work (and very hard to test).
 

comment number: 3265494 
body: @laanwj exactly, I was proposing writing a patch specific to this case, not modifying bitcoin to ignore errors in general.
 

comment number: 3266500 
body: I like the idea of the -fixwallet switch.  Sometime things happen and you never know if you had backed up a corrupt file when the program itself works fine with it.  If I ever get my coins out of the wallet I can send you guys the corrupt wallet.dat file so you can check out what's going on with it.

btw is there a general BTC address I can send some coins to support all the help?

Thanks!!
 

comment number: 3266537 
body: Try building off master + this commit:
https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/commit/06dee4caf1410181b2f6097b5b3311300659c185
it is absolutely not for use, but if you have coins on the right keys, you might be able to send them to a new wallet (no guarantees it wont crash on send).
Sorry, I dont have an osx box to build a binary for you.
 

comment number: 3266540 
body: There is no address for supporting all the developers, though most of them have addresses in their forum sigs (gavin asks that people donate to the faucet instead, which is always a good idea to help new people try bitcoin - freebitcoins.appspot.com )
 

comment number: 3266558 
body: i am using mac osx...how do I compile the file with the added code???  I quit programming since college lol

(edit)
I can switch to windows if anything....
I assume I copy the QT folder from the branch and compile the main.cpp file with the added code?
 

comment number: 3266580 
body: If you are setup to build on osx (doc/build-osx.txt might help if you arent) you can grab a zip of that revision at https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/zipball/06dee4caf1410181b2f6097b5b3311300659c185 which you can build from, otherwise you'll have to find someone to build for you (maybe gavin would be willing to when hes back around after the holidays)
 

comment number: 3266587 
body: Thank's i'll give it a try... After many years I end up programming again haha
 

comment number: 3266599 
body: If its easier, I can whip up a windows or linux build, I just dont have a mac conveniently available atm...
 

comment number: 3266610 
body: if you can do windows that'll be great!!  Otherwise i will have to wait for xcode for the mac to finish downloading.  1.7gig download is going to take a while.
 

comment number: 3266630 
body: When the build at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/job/Bitcoin-Testing-Build/16/console is done, you should be able to grab the modified bitcoin-qt.exe at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/job/Bitcoin-Testing-Build/ws/
 

comment number: 3266668 
body: Oh, and dont dare sending any amount less than the full wallet balance while using this modified version, it might mean your coins go to an address which people actively watch and swipe coins form when they appear (privkey 00000....)
 

comment number: 3266762 
body: ok so I tried running the program with the modified exe.  I tried entering the password and it's telling me it's wrong.  I am sure I used the same one that crashes the program before.

Also notice the file size is different from the release version.  About 273kb smaller then original build.... is that normal??  I would think the file would be bigger since you added a few lines.
 

comment number: 3266783 
body: Oops, missed that, new version uploaded, just wait for its build.
Filesize: meh, its being built with a different set of libs on a different machine filesize is gonna change, the build is fine.

comment number: 3266918 
body: ok so now it sort of works.  New error: Transaction creation failed

Happens after i hit the sent button.
 

comment number: 3266942 
body: Thought so, maybe try (after backing up the wallet) stripping transactions see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11331.0 and opening bitcoin (the modified version) with -rescan.
 

comment number: 3270061 
body: Oh, actually that rescan wont work...well Im not sure how it could be easily done...might be easier to at least check how corrupted the wallet is first, Ill whip something up after a couple days...
 

comment number: 3272082 
body: Hey thanks again!  I went a head and mess around with the revision fixwallet.py you posted on the last site you directed me to.

With the unmodified version of bitcointools i can see pubkey ..... encrypted ....prikey.....
With the modified version I get [Skipping item of type ckey](the ones with the --notxes and additional switches)

This makes me think that I would need to first remove the decryption from the wallet file in order to send out my coins.  The unmodified version of the bitcointools seem to see the wallet just fine.  I think it's just the matter of using the password I have and decrypt it back to a non-passphrase state.

Worse case scenario, i'll just have to send you my wallet file.

body: Can you check with current 0.6.2 and close th issue if this is fixed.
 

comment number: 6220117 
body: 0.6.2: not fixed
 

comment number: 6220207 
body: Tried it with 0.6.2 and you are right, same behaviour here.

My own build (using Qt 4.8.1) does not suffer from this. So it could be a Qt bug or it's fixed in current master.
 

comment number: 6510383 
body: Still present with 0.6.3.RC1.
 

comment number: 8800123 
body: Still present with 0.7 (Qt 4.7.4 based)!
@laanwj What is your opinion on switching to Qt 4.8.2 (which is what the pull tester is using)?
 

comment number: 8800192 
body: No problem with that.
 

comment number: 9068132 
body: @Vort Can you please test, if switching to Qt 4.8.2 fixed this problem for you?

You can download a bitcoin-qt.exe based on Qt 4.8.2 here:
http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/26809acbf9d62480375dd8c1875e8bd7faa1d75e/bitcoin/

It was build by our pull tester bot, you can try with a new wallet, if you don't want to use your live wallet :).
 

comment number: 9102169 
body: bitcoin-qt.exe 7a4d5e122c6a3a0ed37b55a007272352
Works fine!
 

comment number: 9102196 
body: @Vort Thanks for reporting back, you can then close the issue :).
 

443. bug report number : ['702']
comment number: 3177688 
body: The message is printed to stderr. Does windows allow console output for UI programs at all? 

It has always been my experience that windows UI programs detach from the terminal as soon as they're executed, and that they show a window with the help message.

Maybe we should to that too.
 

comment number: 3178102 
body: hmm...

> bitcoin-qt.exe --help 2> help.txt

works well

but I think window with help text is needed anyway
 

comment number: 3178961 
body: Windows UI programs dont choose to detach from the console, but the console detaches them if it sees the UI flag set in the PE binary.  bitcoin-wx di show the --help output in a dialog window, so the basic code in AppInit2 (IIRC) should be able to easily support it.
 

comment number: 4024574 
body: Fixed in pull request #857
